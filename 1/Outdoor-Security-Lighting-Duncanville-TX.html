<p>Electrical Contractor - You must have held a supervisory or managerial position in commercial, industrial or residential electrical work. Your electrical panel is one of the most important components of your electrical system. Have any extension cord that feels more than comfortably warm checked by an electrician. When outlets are installed upside down, the ground prong is facing up, meaning it's nearly impossible to cause a spark in the event the plug pulls away from the wall.</p>
