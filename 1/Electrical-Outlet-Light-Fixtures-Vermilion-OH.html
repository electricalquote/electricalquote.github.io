Putting it into easily digestible words, a standby generator works with two major parts: it works with the generator itself and with a transfer switch. Be conscientious because, even though you've got the power off to the circuit you're working on, there are most likely wires behind your wall, and you don't want to get into a live circuit behind your wall.</p>
