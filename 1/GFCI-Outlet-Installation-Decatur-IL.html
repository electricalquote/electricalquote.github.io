<p>This receptacle is mounted right on an electrical device box and hence, unlike strip type surge kits they do not present the danger of falling off and creating hazards. These receptacles usually come as external devices that need to be fixed onto electrical outlets. Exterior light fixtures can be used to showcase your garden and landscaping and act as a security feature. I suggest you check each wire for power with the switch on and then off. Students will learn the trade through the hands-on application of skills needed to install, repair and maintain electrical wiring.</p>
