<p>Blue Streak technicians are trained to work on all types of lighting fixtures. Outdoor low voltage lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes and can provide safety and beauty to your home - and it doesn't have to cost a fortune to install. Without a breaker panel, none of your electronic devices or appliances will work. The first thing that you're going to want to do and this is the most important, is to make sure that the electricity they shut off, to the light fixture that you are about to be working on.
