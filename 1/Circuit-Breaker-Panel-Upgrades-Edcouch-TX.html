Always make sure that you reach out to a knowledgeable electrician Dallas, Texas company so that you can best understand what level of surge protection you are going to need for your situation. However, as more and more electrical devices and appliances find their way into your home, the current amps in your electrical panel may not be able to meet your needs.</p>

<h3>Home Backup Generator Package Edcouch TX 78538</h3>
<p>To better identify electric problems, one should know first what a consumer unit is and the switches that go along with it. Basically, the consumer unit is responsible for electrical distribution in the panels installed at home. Many older homes use fuse boxes to govern electricity, but upgrading to a circuit breaker panel will make your home more efficient and lessen the chance of an electrical fire. When you choose a whole-home generator, you'll not only be able to keep the lights on, but also run major appliances, like your refrigerator, during an outage.</p>
<p>You can then put the old outlet off to the side and you'll be left with five wires: two black wires, two white wires, and one ground wire. The Briggs & Stratton generator is fitted with a 200-amp automatic transfer switch and computer-controlled load management power switching. A home's breaker box is central to the electrical system. That is why you will need to have your electrical panel replaced after two decades. IEC's team of highly trained, certified electrical contracting personnel can design, build and complete your project to your specification and on schedule.</p>
