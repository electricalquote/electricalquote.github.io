<p>Some older equipment and wiring appeared well-maintained, performing effectively and safely. There are some simple steps homeowners can take to protect their families and homes from electrical hazards. Imagine the amount of damage caused to the components of an electric circuit in case of excess current or short circuit. Some older electrical panels have outdated technology, and its best to replace them. 7. Run the low-voltage wire down the side of the end rail post.</p>
<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
