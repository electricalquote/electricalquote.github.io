<p>If you have children or grandchildren, put protectors in all your outlets or replace them with tamper-resistant outlets , as these outlets are now required by code in all new homes. In Victoria, a licensed electrician is qualified to carry out all types of electrical work. Surge protection should be layered in the house to be at both the electrical service to protect the whole home and at the point of use to protect sensitive electronics.
