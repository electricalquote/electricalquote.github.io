The Basic Electrical Wiring Certificate provides fundamental knowledge of electrical wiring and AC and DC circuits. To keep pace with today's fast-growing, innovative business climate, we strive to remain on the cutting edge of electrical installations by using the latest technology. The most basic method of supplying backup power is running a portable generator in your yard, then plugging in extension cords that plug into your appliances.</p>

So before the next threat of severe storms and power outages, give us a call to get a backup generator installed for your home.
