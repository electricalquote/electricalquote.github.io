<p>With a simple service call, we'll get your lighting system looking like new again whether we installed it originally or it was an existing system. After your service panel is upgraded, there's a step you can take to get even higher performance from your home electric system. Generally, yellow colored wirings are used as switch legs for controlling units such as fans, light and other outlets that require switches. If you aren't sure if your home has 220 volt service, call up your utility company, or have an electrician come take a look.</p>
<p>Took about 4 days to install - including leveling a 20" grade, building a pad, drilling a brick and 8" thick concrete basement wall, transfer switch installation and gas line installation. While an electrical panel can last for as much as 50 years or more, it's generally considered safe practice to replace it every 25 years. First remove or repair any loose electrical lines. From tamper-resistant receptacles to GFCI (Ground Fault Current Interrupter) outlets, there are now safer electrical options that you might want to consider including in your home.</p>

<p>Electrical Journeyperson - You must show proof of four years of experience and 576 hours of approved training.
