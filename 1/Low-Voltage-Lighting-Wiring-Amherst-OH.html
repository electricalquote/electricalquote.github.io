Your transformer needs to be the right wattage to accommodate the lighting you plan to install. If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
<p>But when it comes to outdoor landscape lighting, 120v has some drawbacks. Finally, get licensed or certified (if required). A common mistake is to get the largest unit available to power the entire house. Many electricians consider old panels that have been manufactured by Zinsco and FPE to be very problematic.

The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
