<p>Ensuring your electrical systems are up-to-date is a major issue to keep your home safe. The white neutral wire in the new switch box complies with NEC 2011 requirements. Therefore, you want to experience a slight voltage drop to all lamps in your low voltage lighting system.

The simplest installation is one where the power source and new outlet are within the same wall segment but face opposite directions.</p>

Your home is outfitted with hundreds of lighting fixtures designed to provide light and comfort when it's dark.
