True Power Technology is also a key highlight like with many other Generac generators, and it delivers top-notch power with less than 5% THD to run sensitive appliances and electronics safely and smoothly. The board hosts a set of circuits that transfer power to all the rooms in your home powering things like lights, outlets, and more.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
