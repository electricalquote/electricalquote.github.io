We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire. MVP Electric, Heating & Cooling provides professional electrical services in Kansas City, MO and the surrounding areas. Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>The new electrical panels do come with trip switches that simply cuts off the power when there is an overload. With our monthly lighting inspection, the Alameda Electric team works in partnership with your team to represent your property in the best possible way. Whether you've just bought a new home, are tired of dealing with faulty electricity, or have gotten a notice from the city, our electricians at Fox & Sons can help bring your breaker panel up to code quickly and affordably.</p>
