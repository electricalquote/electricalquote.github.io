<p>Surge protectors are typically installed connected to a home's electrical service box. You can imagine these little wires that lead through your house to your electrical outlet are going to be a lot like the veins and capillaries of your house leading back to the main arteries that connect to the electrical panel. Brighten up exterior spaces to provide the safety and security you need at night while highlighting trees and shrubs. Today's computers, appliances and home theater equipment are more sophisticated than ever and are especially vulnerable to electrical surges.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire.
