You can imagine these little wires that lead through your house to your electrical outlet are going to be a lot like the veins and capillaries of your house leading back to the main arteries that connect to the electrical panel. Brighten up exterior spaces to provide the safety and security you need at night while highlighting trees and shrubs. Today's computers, appliances and home theater equipment are more sophisticated than ever and are especially vulnerable to electrical surges.</p>
