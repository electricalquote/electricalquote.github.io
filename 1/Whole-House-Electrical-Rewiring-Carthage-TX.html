<h3>Repair Underground Electrical Wiring in Carthage TX</h3>
<p>Only the most qualified, professional electricians join the Mr. Electric team. Generator breakdowns can occur at the most inconvenient times, so rely on our certified, skilled technicians to make the repair quickly and correctly the first time. Homeowners hire Mister Sparky electricians to get their residential jobs done right and completed on time. To protect all the wiring in that circuit, a 15-amp circuit breaker is installed. When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>
<p>Replacing the main circuit breaker costs between $40 to $100 for the part and another $40 to $100 per hour to have an electrician install it. The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.
