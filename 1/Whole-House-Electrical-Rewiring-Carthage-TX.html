Homeowners hire Mister Sparky electricians to get their residential jobs done right and completed on time. To protect all the wiring in that circuit, a 15-amp circuit breaker is installed. When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>
