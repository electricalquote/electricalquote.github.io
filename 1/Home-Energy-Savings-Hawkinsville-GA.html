<h3>How to Protect Your Restaurant Against Power Surges in Hawkinsville GA</h3>
<p>This voltage drop is why you're seeing your lights dim. Furthermore, when low voltage fixtures need maintenance, the skill of that labor to understand the system and identify where a transformer that's powering a low voltage fixture is could come at a premium. It is most common to put the red wire on the bottom screw, since that will make the top plug-in "hot" at all times and will be a little easier to plug things into it. A spool of cable is what you see at the home center, and here in the United States it normally will contain two insulated wires and an uninsulated bare copper ground wire.</p>

The Joule rating number defines how much energy a MOV-based surge protector can theoretically absorb in a single event, without failure. Lighting can be incorporated into your landscape in a variety of ways, but the fun is in creating a unique look that reflects your own personal taste and lifestyle.</p>

<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
