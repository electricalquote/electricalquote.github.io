<p>It covers essential circuits or whole house coverage, and produces clean power for sensitive electronics and appliances. Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>Wolf electricians have the expertise and experience needed to review your current panel and provide you with the best upgrade plan for your home and requirements. Electrical Contractor License: The Department of Community and Economic Development registration is required. Turn off all electrical appliances when you go out.
