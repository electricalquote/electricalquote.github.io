<p>The popularity of outdoor living has brought a new focus to outdoor lighting. From landscape lighting to area lights and architectural sign lighting. Avoid overloading extension cords, power strips, or outlets. Most breaker boxes are 100, 150 or 200 amps. Trust Graf Electric to professionally upgrade or service any type of commercial indoor lighting. It will also give you the peace of mind that the electrical panel is not the hazard it once was. Then, it might be a good idea to look into a standby generator installation.</p>

So before the next threat of severe storms and power outages, give us a call to get a backup generator installed for your home.
