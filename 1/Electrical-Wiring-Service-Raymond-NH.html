True Power Technology is also a key highlight like with many other Generac generators, and it delivers top-notch power with less than 5% THD to run sensitive appliances and electronics safely and smoothly. The board hosts a set of circuits that transfer power to all the rooms in your home powering things like lights, outlets, and more.</p>
<p>Where wiring, or raceways that hold the wiring, must traverse fire-resistance rated walls and floors, the openings are required by local building codes to be firestopped In cases where safety-critical wiring must be kept operational during an accidental fire, fireproofing must be applied to maintain circuit integrity in a manner to comply with a product's certification listing The nature and thickness of any passive fire protection materials used in conjunction with wiring and raceways has a quantifiable impact upon the ampacity derating, because the thermal insulation properties needed for fire resistance also inhibit air cooling of power conductors.</p>
