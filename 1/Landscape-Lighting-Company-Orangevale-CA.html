The first exception under 210.70(A) does not stipulate a maximum or minimum number of switched receptacles. Outdoor fixtures like these are made specifically to withstand any type of weather condition included rain, snow, and ice. The Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) reports over 28,000 home fires a year in the U.S. are caused by arc faults.</p>

Electrical upgrades are rarely simple.

You can use a tiny screwdriver or a paper clip to remove the pushed in wires. Most of the time, however, even common electrical issues can be easy to overlook such as dimming lights, faulty light switches and not having enough power outlets because they seem harmless.</p>
