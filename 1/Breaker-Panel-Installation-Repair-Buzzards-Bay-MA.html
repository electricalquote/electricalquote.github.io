Even low-voltage installers can still experience unsettling shocks, especially if they are working in an unsafe environment, such as if they are ungrounded or standing on a wet spot,‚Äù Johnston said. This change will alter the wiring coming into your home, meaning that the replacement breakers will not match the existing fuse sizes. Where a stationary generator would be required are situations where power must be restored immediately should an outage occur.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage.

<p>One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service.

If you find electrical wires in your attic that are laying on top of the installation or you can see the plastic connectors, it wouldn't be a bad idea to call a local electrician to get some advice and see if there are any problems that need to be repaired. Electricians travel each day to a job site, which may be new construction or an existing residential building, and may work alone or in teams depending on the size of the job.</p>
