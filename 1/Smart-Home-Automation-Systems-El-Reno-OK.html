Electricians will plan the lighting installation with you and complete any installation and testing required. As seems to frequently be the case, we have not had extended electrical outages since the installation (we had many before), but have had several from 2 to 6 hours.</p>

If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Or, a degree from an authorized electrical trade school, along with 2 years of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician.
