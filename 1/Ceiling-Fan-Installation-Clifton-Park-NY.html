Sometimes the wiring at a light box is passing the circuit through to various outlets in the area, so that care must be taken to connect everything back as it was. In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>

Also, the amazing whole house generator comes with a highly efficient and reliable ATS 200 transfer switch that will ensure excellent power management.

TESCO's warranty, should a TESCO device receive a surge and fail to protect your equipment; direct lightning strikes excluded.</p>
<p>Ground faults occur when electricity escapes bare, damaged, wet, or poorly insulated wires and takes a shortcut to the ground.
