<p>Keep in mind, that like most of the older Generac generators this one probably shouldn't be used if you're anticipating days and days of your power being out.

And, is a must-have tool for troubleshooting a system. Solar outdoor lighting systems charge their batteries during the day and produce a low voltage light during the night time hours.</p>
