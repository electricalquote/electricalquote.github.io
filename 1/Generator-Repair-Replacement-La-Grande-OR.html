<p>Based on the unit installed, emergency power can be supplied to some or all of your residence of place of business. The running” capacity shows the maximum power the system can operate at over extended periods of time, while the starting capacity shows the maximum power the system can get to for a few seconds. It also comes with a 200-amp automatic transfer switch, which switches on the generator when electricity is cut off. There are a few different styles of landscaping lights, too.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage.
