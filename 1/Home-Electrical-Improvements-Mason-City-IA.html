<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>When lightning strikes near a building with no protection, it can travel inside via power lines directly connected to the switchboard. Many people are currently doing this improvement, because in the majority of homes, circuit breaker panels are usually 100 amp. And all modern Wi-Fi enabled, digital dimmers and USB charging outlets are tight fits in older single gang boxes.

Electrical boxes should be mounted 18‚Äù to center off the floor for outlets. If the outlet you're replacing is at the end of the circuit, it wouldn't have the extra pair of black and white wires, since it doesn't need to continue the circuit, so you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and one ground wire in that case.</p>
