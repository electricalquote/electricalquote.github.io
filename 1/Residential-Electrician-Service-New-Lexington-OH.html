If you've read our long article on electricity , you'll know that an electric current is a flow of electrons (tiny particles inside atoms ) carrying energy through a metal or another substance in a loop called a circuit.</p>

Yes, but it would have to be a three-way switch and wired in a completely radical way with additional wires between the switch and outlet. Whole home generators are a valuable asset to any home that relies on electricity to function effectively. Electricians read blueprints, which include technical diagrams of electrical systems that show the location of circuits, outlets, and other equipment.</p>
