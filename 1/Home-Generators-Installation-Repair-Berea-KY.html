<p>Parallel wiring is the standard for 120 volt circuits in the entire house, making possible the independent use of all appliances, supplied by the same voltage.

Reach out to the professionals at All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating to learn more about our comprehensive electrical services and how they can help your home run more efficiently. The source for the circuit is at the switch and 2-wire cable runs to each receptacle outlet.</p>
<p>Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits. You can design your wire route so that it reaches each fixture and then returns to the transformer.

The white (neutral) wire connects to the silver screw, or you place it in the back wire hole on the same side of the device as the silver screw.
