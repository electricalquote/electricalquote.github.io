<p>Fleet management and maintenance consulting services for commercial and local government markets. Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more ‘layers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed. This is particularly true with a generator since the whole point is protecting your family during an already-stressful power outage.</p>
