MVP Electric, Heating & Cooling provides professional electrical services in Kansas City, MO and the surrounding areas. Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>First, connecting the wires leading to downstream outlets with wire connectors creates a more secure connection. Hook the wires onto the new receptacle.
