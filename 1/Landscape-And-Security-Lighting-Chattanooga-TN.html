True Power Technology is also a key highlight like with many other Generac generators, and it delivers top-notch power with less than 5% THD to run sensitive appliances and electronics safely and smoothly. The board hosts a set of circuits that transfer power to all the rooms in your home powering things like lights, outlets, and more.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>

Trust Graf Electric to professionally upgrade or service any type of commercial indoor lighting. It will also give you the peace of mind that the electrical panel is not the hazard it once was.
