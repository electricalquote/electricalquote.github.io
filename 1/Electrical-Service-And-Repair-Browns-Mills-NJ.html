<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>Some electricians — especially those who haven't been around for a while or who aren't really savvy with the code — will steer customers in a different direction just for not having the correct knowledge,” Volpe says. Can provide service for the lifetime of the generator. This is because these circuits will likely take appliances that draw greater amperage.
