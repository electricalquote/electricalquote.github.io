I have extensive experience in plumbing, electrical, drywall, roofing and many other facets of home repair. Our interactive program covers modern industry trends such as smart home technology, and includes a virtual simulation experience, student discounts from Snap-on, and complies with the latest version of the National Electrical Code®. The safest way to run a generator is by installing a transfer switch.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>

<p>The main types of circuit breakers are single pole, double pole, arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCO) and ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI). Generally, the rule is that the generator should be located as close as possible to the fuel supply and transfer switch.

Electricians passionate about their profession should find numerous opportunities throughout their careers.</p>
