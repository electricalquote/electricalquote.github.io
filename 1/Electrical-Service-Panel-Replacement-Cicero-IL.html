<p>The first step in your landscape lighting adventure will be figuring out what areas you want to light and what fixtures would be best for them. Consider your electrical needs and requirements for rooms having visual presentation technology, such as slideshows, by consulting a qualified electrician. Light switches and outlets in your home may not seem like a big to-do at first, but when it comes to your home's electrical system, their the point of entry for every single thing you need to do.

Restricted Electrical Licences (RELs) are issued to persons other than electricians to legally carry out a "restricted" range of electrical tasks. If your home is older, it may have a fused-based electrical system.</p>
