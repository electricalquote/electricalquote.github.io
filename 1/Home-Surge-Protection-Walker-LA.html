<p>After you have approved your design plan, we'll begin the outdoor installation process. A. For basic generator installations we install a power inlet for your portable generator to plug into during a power outage. The fixtures are designed to withstand moisture, but calcium and lime deposits; hard water scale and dirt will build up on the lenses, dramatically reducing the light output.

There are many different types of electrical outlets, some of which are required for specific appliances. Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system. If your breaker box isn't functioning properly, it's very likely your home's appliances won't function properly either.</p>
