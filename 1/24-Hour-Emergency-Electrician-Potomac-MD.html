<p>Fuse boxes; especially those that were installed prior to 1960, need to be upgraded to circuit breakers for added safety. Even with an all-LED lighting scheme running on DC circuits, the house would still need conventional 120-volt AC current for appliances and other plug-in devices. The variety of applications is significant as a result, ranging from decorative street lighting, commercial parking lot lighting, car lot lighting, outdoor landscape lighting, architectural lighting, security lighting, and general site lighting.</p>

<h3>Choosing Reliable Potomac MD Electrical Contractors</h3>

Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
