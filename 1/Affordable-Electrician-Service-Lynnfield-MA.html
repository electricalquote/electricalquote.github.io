The bare ground wire—if there is one— is connected to the green grounding screw on the switch.

<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights.

<h3>New And Creative Ways To Use Landscape Lights In Your Garden Lynnfield MA 01940</h3>
<p>First, the lack of a ground wire (I assume there was none in the box - that they were not spliced together and folded into the back of the switch box) is a little troubling. Each circuit breaker manages the electrical flow to a segment of your house. Residential electricians work with people on a regular basis. TPS TranSafe Enabled - Our patented TranSafe fault current protection circuitry provides peace of mind that your electronic loads are protected and that your electrical system will not go down due to SPD fault control operations.</p>
<p>You may want to consider purchasing a battery backup surge protector to safeguard your computer against potential loss of data during a momentary loss of power as a result of an electrical storm or accidental power outage. If your system was not installed by a licensed electrician - many low voltage systems are installed by gardeners, landscape irrigates and by homeowners themselves - choose a reputable outdoor lighting company that offers a maintenance plan to keep your system looking great and performing optimally.</p>
