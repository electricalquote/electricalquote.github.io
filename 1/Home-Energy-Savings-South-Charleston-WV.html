Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond.

These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time.
