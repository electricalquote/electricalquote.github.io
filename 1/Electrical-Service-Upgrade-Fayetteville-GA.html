Journeyman License: It requires a 4-year experience one of which can be obtained through an approved training program. It is useless to install solar lighting system that can not be successfully maintained for sustained operation.

These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family. Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>
