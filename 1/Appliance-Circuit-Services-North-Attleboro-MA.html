<p>Employ only a certified electrician with training and experience in safety practices and procedures, as well as the proper equipment, to perform all major electrical installation or repair. The whole fixture is used as a heat sink for the LED to ensure it continues lighting for years to come. The electrical panel is an important and foundational part of your electrical system. For instance, if you have a Federal Pacific or Zinsco electrical panel, you should know that these were very common in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC.

<p>It is best, then, to have a professional install these low voltage landscape lights to minimize the risk of physical equipment damage. When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>

Thankfully, it wasn't anything more serious, but it woke you up about electrical safety.</p>
<p>They can be installed at ground level and pointed upward or at roof level and aimed downward. In the UK for example, a non qualified person is only allowed to wire an electrical plug and replace a power socket or light fitting or switch but not fit new items or install new wiring.
