Intermittent humming or crackling noises coming from the electrical panel are reasons to call an electrician immediately.</p>

This type of electrical panel has fuses that burn out, then need replacement. With our thorough electrical safety inspections , we'll be able to identify any problems or issues your system may have and repair them properly. At this point, use a voltage tester to see if the power is truly off to the light switch before you go any further.</p>
