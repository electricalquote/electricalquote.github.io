We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office.

<p>Safety: Allow your residents and visitors to more safely navigate your property at night with a custom outdoor lighting design. Information: This type of lighting can easily be installed by a do-it-yourselfer. Circuit breaker panels are rated by amperage, or amps, as a measure of their electrical capacity. For more information, contact your local or state electrical licensing board. If you want both switches to operate the new lights, use the switched wire as a hot - if not, use the permanent hot as the hot wire.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to check the validity of an electrical contractor's license and insurance is to ask for it. Properly qualified electricians will happily provide the evidence to assure you of their accreditation and insurance. Based on the severity of the problem, our electrician will give you upfront pricing on the cost to repair or replace your panel. Whole-home surge protectors are installed at your circuit breaker, and they prevent power surges from reaching your electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Home electrical wiring can seem mysterious, but have no fear: This helpful guide will help you understand how wiring works and how to work with wire. Key skills for electricians include critical thinking, problem solving, customer service, troubleshooting skills and excellent vision. You can be confident that regardless of whichever generator you choose from our reviews above, you will end up with something top-notch quality that will come in handy during power outages.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, low-voltage DC wiring (for example, wiring for 12 volts or 24 volts DC) needs to have a bigger wire gauge, not a smaller wire gauge, than 120-volt AC wiring (assuming loads of the same wattage),” Holladay says.
