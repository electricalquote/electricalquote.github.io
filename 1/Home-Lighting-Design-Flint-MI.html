<p>Low voltage landscape lighting only require a shallow trench, and can even be left above ground, if preferred, though this may put wiring at risk from lawn equipment. You may have difficulty selling your home if you do not have the right electrical safety certificates. However, there is a general understanding within the electrical trade of the standard duties and skills associated with residential electrical installation, upgrades and repair. The correct safety procedures to be used in troubleshooting electrical equipment will be explained in detail.</p>

Electrical upgrades are rarely simple. Just like your heating and cooling system is controlled by a thermostat, a Kohler generator is controlled by a transfer switch that senses when utility power fails, starting the generator automatically within seconds.

<p>If you want to install lighting fixtures in your garden or yard and design it so that it requires a constant flow of current, you need to have a current transformer that will measure the electrical current that comes into the device and distribute it to whatever lighting fixture that is connected to it.

You should check your house for electrical safety at least once every ten years, or if you have recently moved into a new home.
