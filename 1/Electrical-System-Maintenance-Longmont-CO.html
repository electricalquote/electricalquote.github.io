<p>However, you are approaching the age threshold and we would recommend having an annual electrical inspection performed by either a certified home inspector or a licensed electrician. While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter outlet, or GFCI, is a circuit breaker outlet.

This course is designed to familiarize participants with the use of basic troubleshooting procedures to troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits.

It will also switch any and all outlets downstream from the GFCI that depend on the GFCI for protection.</p>
