Basically, the electrical current flows from the wall to your surge protector and then to your electrical devices.</p>
<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought.
