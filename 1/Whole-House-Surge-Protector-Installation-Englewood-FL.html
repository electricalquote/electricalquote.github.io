<p>As defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , a ''relay'' is "a device that is operated by a variation in the conditions of one electric circuit to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another electric circuit." A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of electrocution and fires, the National Electrical Code requires specific types of outlets in certain locations. Most states require electricians to be licensed. Electrical upgrades are rarely simple. Just like your heating and cooling system is controlled by a thermostat, a Kohler generator is controlled by a transfer switch that senses when utility power fails, starting the generator automatically within seconds. This Champion Power Equipment whole house generator gets an edge over most others in its class from the fact that it provides a quieter and more residential-friendly operation with its 63 dB noise level.</p>

In case you are looking to design or redo your home's lighting, then you might be considering to do this as a Do-It-Yourself project. An automatic standby generator system monitors incoming voltage from the utility power line supplying a home or building with electricity via automatic transfer switch that is integrated into the structures electrical system.</p>

This article will walk you through how a basic electrical outlet works, and a few different types of outlets you may have in your home.
