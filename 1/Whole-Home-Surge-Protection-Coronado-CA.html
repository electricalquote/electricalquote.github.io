<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>It is important to repair or replace old or damaged electrical wiring before it becomes a hazard. Extension cords are intended for temporary use. Because having a grounding wire and grounded (three-pronged) outlets adds an extra level of safety, newer houses and buildings are required to have three-pronged outlets with grounding wires. I do not suggest that you remove the breaker panel cover which will show all the wiring from the circuits, but you could turn the breaker off to a room and remove the cover plates to the light switches and receptacles and loosen the screws that hold them in the electrical box.</p>
