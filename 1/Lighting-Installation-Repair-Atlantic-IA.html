When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire. MVP Electric, Heating & Cooling provides professional electrical services in Kansas City, MO and the surrounding areas. Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>Pulling on a cord can damage the appliance, the plug or the outlet. If you are planning a home lighting design project, you obviously want to leave the task to someone who knows what they are doing. A master electrician is not only permitted to work on his own, he is the one who can bid for jobs, pull permits, lay out wiring systems and installations. The surge protector passes the surge along from the device to the system ground. It's important to note that surge protectors don't give you complete protection.</p>
<p>Whether you're installing new appliances or remodeling your home, you may need to repair or install new electrical switches or outlets. 1. Layout the fixtures on the ground first so you get the layout you want. If you answered yes to our questions above, or find that your current panel doesn't meet modern home electricity requirements, you may decide it's time for an upgrade. If we need to repair damaged wires, replace non-NEC compliant wires, or otherwise upgrade your dated two-prong to three-prong wall outlets, we can perform all of these services while we're at your home to repair your electrical panel.</p>
