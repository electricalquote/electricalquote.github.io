If you hear any popping, crackling, sizzling, or buzzing coming from your outlets, switches, or appliances, there could be a serious problem. Backup house generators often differ in what fuel source they use to generator their power. For example, if a circuit breaker repeatedly trips after being reset, electricians determine the cause and fix it.</p>

<p>This 12 kW home standby generator can power a home up to 5,500 sq. ft. with a 4-ton air conditioner or other large or small appliances plugged on.

In order for this to happen, there may need to be an energy management system installed that controls what is powered on and at what time.
