For example, if your lights consume 100 watts of power, you'll need a power supply that's rated for at least 120 watts (100 x 1.2). If you're planning on adding more lights in the future, buy a transformer that's rated for more wattage than you currently need. Fortunately, with the help of an emergency electrician, you can get back to normal quickly. Completely wireless and battery powered, Generac's Wireless Monitor provides you with instant status information without ever leaving the house.</p>

For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment.
