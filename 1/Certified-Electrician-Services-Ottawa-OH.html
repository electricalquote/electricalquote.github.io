<p>Master Electrician - You must be at least 22 years of age. 4 The company was expanding rapidly, opening new branches and factories and trading in 'everything electrical', a phrase that was to become synonymous with GEC. It is generally recommended to replace fuse boxes with electrical panels that use circuit breakers. Georgia Power helps businesses make smart investments in energy efficiency.
