<p>If you have children or grandchildren, put protectors in all your outlets or replace them with tamper-resistant outlets , as these outlets are now required by code in all new homes. In Victoria, a licensed electrician is qualified to carry out all types of electrical work. Surge protection should be layered in the house to be at both the electrical service to protect the whole home and at the point of use to protect sensitive electronics. On the other hand, from an electrician's perspective, the two main phases of construction include phase one - the rough in, and phase two - the finish.</p>
<p>I pig-tailed my hots, neutrals, & grounds (well crimped & trimmed all but 1), which obviously gives you longer wire to work with the receptacle, but it also made tucking the rest of the wire into the receptacle easier. The registration requirement applies to beginning electricians, electrical apprentices, industrial electrical apprentices, and residential electrical apprentices. Go to a supply house and buy large transformers and quality metal fixtures, not the plastic junk normally asociated with low voltage.</p>
