<p>As a homeowner, it's wise to know where the breaker panel in your house is located in the case of an emergency or the sudden need to cut off or restore power. Since Georgia is faced with a substantial amount of thunderstorms each year, surge protection is a concern for every Georgia homeowner and consumer. Too few switches, outlets and lights.

If larger wire is necessary to counter voltage drop in long runs, Type UF (Underground Feeder and Branch circuit) cable could be used.
