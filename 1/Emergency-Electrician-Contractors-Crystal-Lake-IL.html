<p>About the only electrical code restriction for a low voltage system is that the transformer be connected to a GFCI protected receptacle or circuit, when installed in locations that require GFCI protection (see Common GFCI Location Requirements ). When it comes to household electricity, there's a lot more to consider than simply turning a switch On and Off. This applies especially to landlords, who would breach the law if the tenants' health is jeopardised by unlicensed electrical repairs.</p>
<p>New wiring, connection boxes, electrical panels and even lighting fixtures will all add to the project's cost. That said, you can actually get a limited selection of metal fixtures at the big box stores, just watch for the cheap transformers that may be displayed.

Electrical boxes should be mounted 18” to center off the floor for outlets. If the outlet you're replacing is at the end of the circuit, it wouldn't have the extra pair of black and white wires, since it doesn't need to continue the circuit, so you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and one ground wire in that case.</p>
