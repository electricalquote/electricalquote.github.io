A home standby generator system has two parts: the generator unit and an automatic transfer switch. Typical home electrical cable has a bare ground wire and two insulated wires inside. To offer renewable solar energy systems that replace conventional power generation solutions.

Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts.
