Don't go outside to check the damage before an electrician arrives, especially during a storm, as fallen power lines are easily concealed and can be deadly. Teach all family members to avoid touching electrical devices when they are wet, in water, or standing on a wet surface. If you are looking for a system to power your heater and one other appliance (a total of 16 circuits), purchase the 11kw generator at $3,000.</p>
<p>Choose this system if you are using new style GE RS series snap-in electrical devices without a strap and wish to mimic the format of the old style Bryant or General Electric wall plates and light switches. Be sure to carefully read the list of all components included with any generator you're thinking about buying, and price a transfer switch separately if it's not part of the package. When you call our 24 hour number, all calls are answered by licensed electricians.</p>

We offer emergency generator service, including repairs, which can restore power when you need it most. Even if the breaker of a wall outlet trips because of overload, the lights will remain on.</p>
<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source. If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>
