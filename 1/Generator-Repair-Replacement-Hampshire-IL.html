Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Electrical Safety - Review ESFI recommendations and safety tips before you decide to tackle electrical projects in your home. If you have an electrical issue to deal with around your home, the safest thing you can do is get in touch with the licensed electricians at ABC Home & Commercial. Many homeowners use LED lights in several areas of the home, both inside and out.</p>
<p>Not all UL listed SPDs are necessarily rated for use with a lightning protection system.
