From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>It is important to repair or replace old or damaged electrical wiring before it becomes a hazard. Extension cords are intended for temporary use.

While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts. Since we started, First Choice Electrical LLC's number one goal has always been to provide superior customer service to residential clients.</p>
