<p>Panel upgrades are imperative to the safety and functionality of your home. If you reside in cold climates, you might want to install a natural gas standby system over diesel or gasoline. Replacing or upgrading your breaker box will help to prevent electrical fires in your home, your appliances should work at peak efficiency, and you'll add value to your home.

With circuit breakers, the breaker will flip off if it cannot handle the amount of electricity that is flowing through it, so you can usually just flip it back on. NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
<p>Whether you want to highlight a few features of your landscape or enhance the entire area, you can achieve your goals with landscape lighting. Some generators are certified to be kept as close as 18 inches from your house. Leave the wire loose as we will be encircling each fixture with a small loop of cable before burying it.
