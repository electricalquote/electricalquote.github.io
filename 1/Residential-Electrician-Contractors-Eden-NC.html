<h3>Circuit Breaker Panel Upgrades Eden NC 27288</h3>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
<p>This was fine in the past, but homes usually require updated panels to handle the higher payloads of modern-day electronics. Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors. To modify the outlet for use as half-hot, use a screwdriver or a pair of needle-nose pliers to twist and break that small connecting tab.</p>

Low Voltage Transformers or Transverters are devices used to provide 24VAC power to the low voltage switches & controls in the building.

Unnecessary and unwanted flickering of landscape lights is one of the most common problems in landscape lighting and you can prevent this from happening using a reliable transformer.</p>
<p>Because these lights lay nearly flush to the ground, they create an entirely different look than the other lights we considered. In other words, if you find yourself constantly tripping your circuit breakers when one appliance is plugged in or turned on, chances are you need to upgrade the circuitry. LED lighting is also a great choice because it is much less expensive than traditional incandescent lighting (saves as much as 50% on power usage) and can last much longer as well.</p>
