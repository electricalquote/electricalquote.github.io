When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible. Just answering the question as to whether you need the system to power the entire house or just emergency loads will help you determine the transfer switch size.</p>
<p>The panel uses the sun to charge a battery on the lamp, eliminating the need for electrical wires and a transformer. These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family. Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>The problem is that a GFCI monitors the current on the neutral and hot wires; when they are unbalanced it will trip. In new construction, GFCI receptacles are required by code where electricity and water are in close proximity, as in the bathroom, kitchen, garage, swimming pool area, crawl-space, unfinished basement, or on exterior outlets. All Coastal Source fixtures are designed to be forever serviceable. This is defined as a business, person or company employing electricians to carry out electrical installation work for profit.</p>
