We can help you to reduce your utility expenses by installing energy efficient lights or solar lamps. Of course, t is essential that you have proper lighting during the night, especially in outdoor spaces and pathways.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced.
