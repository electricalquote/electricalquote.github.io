Teach all family members to avoid touching electrical devices when they are wet, in water, or standing on a wet surface. If you are looking for a system to power your heater and one other appliance (a total of 16 circuits), purchase the 11kw generator at $3,000.</p>
<p>A generator is a back-up electrical system that operates regardless of if you are at home or away. We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office.
