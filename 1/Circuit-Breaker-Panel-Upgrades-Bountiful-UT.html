<p>There is a problem if the voltage climbs above 120 volts, and a surge protector assists to keep that problem from destroying your computer or any other sensitive electric equipments. Maintenance can be performed by skilled installers rather than licensed electricians, whereas for traditional lighting systems a trained electrician is the safe choice. A home inspector might even point out that it is because of knob and tube wiring without an electrician's proper metering equipment and the ability to use it correctly, you will not know for sure.</p>
<p>The earliest standardized method of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: single conductors were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs attached to the structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires. Our Linwood, Northfield, and Egg Harbor Township NJ area team has years of experience installing all different kinds of lighting.</p>
