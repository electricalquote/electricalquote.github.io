<h3>Electrical Services in Clayton GA and Their Know-How</h3>

Your transformer needs to be the right wattage to accommodate the lighting you plan to install. If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
<p>Equip extension cords with ground fault interruption (GFI) devices. LED lighting installation will help you to save money on your electric bill while still enjoying plenty of illumination.
