<p>Chemical finishes, such as our classic "Matte Bronze" and "Rusty" have changed the landscape lighting world forever and are the envy of our competitors (who have been trying for years to duplicate our signature finishes). At Arrow Electric, Inc., we can provide you with a whole-house surge protection to insure your home and electronics from unpredictable power surges. There is no problem too big or small and we can handle all electrical panel problems with effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

Surge protectors provide you with more electrical outlets as well as protect electrical appliances from surges.
