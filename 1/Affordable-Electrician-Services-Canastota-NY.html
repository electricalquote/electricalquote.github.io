<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>As you can see, installing low-voltage lighting systems is relatively simple, if a few simple NEC rules are followed. In case you are looking to design or redo your home's lighting, then you might be considering to do this as a Do-It-Yourself project.

Worst of all, they install different voltages than intended for the system or for the individual wire runs or circuits. An electrician earning a state license means that they have trained a certain number of hours, knows the state codes and regulations, and takes safety seriously.</p>
