Pioneer Electric has lightning arresters on our primary electric lines and we ensure that our system is properly grounded.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released.

Setting up landscape lighting is a good idea when establishing the boundaries of an outdoor path.</p>

The following are some safety tips to consider when using electrical outlets, electrical cords and extension cords.</p>

<p>We'll upgrade your system with new LED bulbs and long lasting, fully integrated fixtures designed to last up to 20 years. You can trust our fully-licensed team of professionals to deliver cost-effective solutions for all sorts of emergency electrical problems, no matter the time of day or night. Electricians are of three major types namely factory, maintenance and construction. These include everything from the NM cables powering your outlets to the UF cables powering your outdoor lamp posts.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
