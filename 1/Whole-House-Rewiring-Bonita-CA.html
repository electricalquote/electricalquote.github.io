After completing this course, participants should be able to explain what an oscilloscope does, explain how to set up an oscilloscope for use, identify the controls used to adjust an oscilloscope display, and explain how to use an oscilloscope to make voltage measurements and time measurements.</p>
<p>A home surge protector will offer you a guarantee your home and electronics receive respectable protection against any electrical upsurge. Just touch the probes between a hot and a neutral, or between two hot wires. Using the wrong size wiring can increase the risk of fires and other serious electrical problems or result in not enough power going to an outlet or other electrical fixture.

<p>Moisture can wreak havoc on a home's electrical system and this generally shows at the panels. It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom. Security lighting systems should provide bright light and motion sensors, in consideration of a homeowners' lifestyle.</p>
<p>All backup generators we carry are backed with a guaranteed written warranty for parts and labor.

In other words, if you find yourself constantly tripping your circuit breakers when one appliance is plugged in or turned on, chances are you need to upgrade the circuitry. LED lighting is also a great choice because it is much less expensive than traditional incandescent lighting (saves as much as 50% on power usage) and can last much longer as well.</p>
