Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>
<p>Choose this system if you are using new style GE RS series snap-in electrical devices without a strap and wish to mimic the format of the old style Bryant or General Electric wall plates and light switches. Be sure to carefully read the list of all components included with any generator you're thinking about buying, and price a transfer switch separately if it's not part of the package. When you call our 24 hour number, all calls are answered by licensed electricians.</p>
