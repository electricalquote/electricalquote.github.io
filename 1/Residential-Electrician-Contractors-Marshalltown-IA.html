<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Without the Ring Bridge, Ring Smart Lights will shine as soon as motion is detected, but you won't be able to pair your Ring Smart Lights into groups, receive notifications or connect Ring Smart Lights to Ring doorbells and cameras and select Alexa-enabled devices.
