<p>New wiring, connection boxes, electrical panels and even lighting fixtures will all add to the project's cost.

The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.” With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off. If you're concerned about protecting equipment while you're away or after office hours, look for surge protectors that completely cut off the power supply after a huge spike.</p>
<p>I will have to check the circuit breaker to see how many amps it can handle. The white wire (neutral wire) needs to be secured under either silver screw on the side of the receptacle.
