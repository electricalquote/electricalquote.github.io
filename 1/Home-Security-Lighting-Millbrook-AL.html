<h3>24 Hrs Electrical Service Millbrook AL 36054</h3>
<p>One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service. Electricity has made our lives more enjoyable in so many ways- but that doesn't mean it comes without its risks-we'll walk you through some electrical safety tips that all homeowners should be aware of. Our trained and experienced electricians have the appropriate tools and expertise to repair and install LED recessed lights with ease and precision. Physical size of the old electrical panel may be too small to preclude its re-use with a panel retrofit kit, so the entire box needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do. You will have to figure out which of the existing switch wires is permanent, and hot and splice into that wire to supply the new switch. Older electrical panels can't always accommodate multiple devices like air conditioners, HDTVs, and clothes dryers running simultaneously. Try to distribute small appliances and electronic devices to several outlets to avoid overwhelming the one.</p>
