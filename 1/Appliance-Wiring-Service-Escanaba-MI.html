With all of the wires reconnected and your new wire in place, carefully tuck the wires back into the electrical box. Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>

This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
<p>First, connecting the wires leading to downstream outlets with wire connectors creates a more secure connection. Hook the wires onto the new receptacle.
