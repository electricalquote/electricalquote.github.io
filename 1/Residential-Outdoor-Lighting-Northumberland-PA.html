An overload can cause a fire, so it's the job of the electrical panel to break the circuit and regulate the electricity in the system to keep your home and family safe.</p>

<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hotâ current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>

It could be simply tightening screws, or it could be that the electrical box itself is not adequately secured in the wall. Common types of surge protection devices include whole-house, point-of-use and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).</p>
