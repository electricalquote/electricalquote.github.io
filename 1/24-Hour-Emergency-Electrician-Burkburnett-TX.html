<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>
<p>Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired. Yes, but it would have to be a three-way switch and wired in a completely radical way with additional wires between the switch and outlet.
