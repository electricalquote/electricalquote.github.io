Cables for industrial, commercial and apartment buildings may contain many insulated conductors in an overall jacket, with helical tape steel or aluminium armour, or steel wire armour, and perhaps as well an overall PVC or lead jacket for protection from moisture and physical damage.</p>
<p>CREATING THIS EFFECT: Path lights are staggered around the walkway to create pools of light that illuminate a safe passage to the home's entrance. Reading blueprints, or technical diagrams of a work site's electrical wiring.
