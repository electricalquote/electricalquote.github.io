<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought. For example, tt is important to make sure your Air Conditioner doesn't turn on before the generator has had some time to get up and running to full capacity.</p>
