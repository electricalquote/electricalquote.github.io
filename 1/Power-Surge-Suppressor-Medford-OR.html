<h3>Commercial, Industrial and Domestic Electrical Services in Medford OR</h3>
<p>Frequently moving fixtures around can result in damage to the lights themselves. While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose. Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
<p>All backup generators we carry are backed with a guaranteed written warranty for parts and labor. This should not come as a surprise, as practically everything in the modern world requires the use of systems that electrical engineers design and develop. If it's raining or the ground is wet, don't use electric power yard tools. This is because they invest more on developing the surge protector to give you the best results. Owners and facility managers who have existing relationships with an electrical contractor, either in terms of maintenance or new installation, have immediate access to a professional who can perform an energy audit for their building.</p>
<p>Another cause, and the most common, is electrical devices that require a lot of power. Other services such as renting, maintenance, repairing, re-fueling, fuel polishing and treatment, load bank testing, megger testing and engine rebuilding are also available. We understand that installing or repairing light fixtures can be disruptive to your day-to-day life and we always strive to work as efficiently and quickly as possible. A licensed electrician can evaluate the situation and make any necessary improvements to your circuit breakers, or they may even suggest that your circuit panel be replaced if it's outdated or potentially dangerous.</p>
