<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this. When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel. Water - Before using an extension cord outside or in a wet area, confirm that the cord is rated for outdoor use and make sure the cord is connected to a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.</p>
<p>6. It's important to size circuit breakers for the wire size they serve. LED fixtures fond of the open air. Low Voltage Transformers or Transverters are devices used to provide 24VAC power to the low voltage switches & controls in the building. Here's the truth: not all electrical contractors are created equal. Turn off power at your circuit breaker panel, the most important step in connecting an electrical outlet.
