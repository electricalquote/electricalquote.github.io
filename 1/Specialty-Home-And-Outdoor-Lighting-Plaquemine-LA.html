<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Personalized Service: Our technicians will inspect your home and determine the correct generator needed to power all your appliances and systems. They can be installed in the ground to uplight statues, fountains, flag poles, trees, or your company logo.

<p>The first step in your landscape lighting adventure will be figuring out what areas you want to light and what fixtures would be best for them. Consider your electrical needs and requirements for rooms having visual presentation technology, such as slideshows, by consulting a qualified electrician. Light switches and outlets in your home may not seem like a big to-do at first, but when it comes to your home's electrical system, their the point of entry for every single thing you need to do. Replacing these in older homes can be a hassle - but necessary - and keeping updated on your maintenance is vital for sustained ease of use and longevity.</p>

<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present.

The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>

Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
