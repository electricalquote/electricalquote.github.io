<p>Every emergency electrician carries a wide variety of electrical parts that he can use to resolve emergency electrical situations. In outdoor settings use only outdoor approved temporary wiring and extension cords. Here at HedgeHog, we also provide commercial electrical emergency services. If you only remove the red and attach the new black where it was, it will not work - by splicing to one of the existing wires and maintaining the terminations, everything will work.</p>
<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
