Electrical wiring is a job that should be left to professionals. Except for the transformer that is connected to the 120v circuit, all the fixtures run on harmless 12v current. This National Electrical Safety Month (NESM), the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) is increasing public awareness of electrical hazards in both the home and in the workplace with its Be in the Know about the New” NESM consumer awareness campaign and the newly released How Do You Know?” workplace safety awareness program.</p>

Pull the plug, not the cord, when disconnecting an electrical device. This flaw can lead to damage to the panel, breakers and home electrical devices, or cause a fire. This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
