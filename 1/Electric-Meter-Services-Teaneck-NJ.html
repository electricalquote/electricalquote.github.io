Sterlite Power (as a division of STL) was awarded India's first Independent Power Transmission Project under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) regime.

<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights.
