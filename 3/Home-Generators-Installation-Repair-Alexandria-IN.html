<p>That's why our team of electricians will be looking out for your safety this fall and be willing to tackle any job if it means you get to live without worry throughout the season. But the main thing is that when emergencies and blackouts strike, you can be ready and maintain a semblance of normalcy in your life through the use of generators (portable or otherwise).

<h3>What Does a Alexandria IN Residential Electrician Do?</h3>
<p>If your circuit breaker fails, it will not stop the flow of electricity when exposed to hazardous conditions. On the other hand, if you want your house to remain lit even during a power outage, you can opt for a small sized generator. PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>In addition, electrical panel upgrade can help in reducing your homeowner's insurance bill. Area electrical board members determine percentage requirements. Another level of safety for your home's electrical system is having a grounded wire and grounded outlets. As you might expect, your generator's power output must match your home's electrical requirements. We understand that electrical issues are not only a major inconvenience but can also be potential fire hazards.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
