Teach all family members to avoid touching electrical devices when they are wet, in water, or standing on a wet surface. If you are looking for a system to power your heater and one other appliance (a total of 16 circuits), purchase the 11kw generator at $3,000.</p>
<p>Like cars, standby generators run nonstop for many hours, so they have to be maintained as if they were, well, cars.
