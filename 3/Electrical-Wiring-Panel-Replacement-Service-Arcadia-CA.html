<p>To install and service Generac & Honeywell generators. Don't go outside to check the damage before an electrician arrives, especially during a storm, as fallen power lines are easily concealed and can be deadly. Teach all family members to avoid touching electrical devices when they are wet, in water, or standing on a wet surface. If you are looking for a system to power your heater and one other appliance (a total of 16 circuits), purchase the 11kw generator at $3,000.</p>
<p>Like cars, standby generators run nonstop for many hours, so they have to be maintained as if they were, well, cars. Call Mr. Electric for a fuse box upgrade in Lilburn if you are unsure of how to handle wiring and fuse box upgrade procedures. A powerful burst of excess voltage can damage your home as well as the computers, appliances, and entertainment systems you keep plugged in. The problem can strike anytime from a lightning storm, blown transformer, or poor electrical supply from the utility company.</p>

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.

<p>Honeywell Home Standby Generators automatically detect a power outage and deliver backup power to your home within seconds. While tests differ, you will need to understand electrical theory, the National Electrical Code®, local electrical codes, and the various types of wiring methods and materials.
