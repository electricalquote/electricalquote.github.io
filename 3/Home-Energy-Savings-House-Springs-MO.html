<p>Low voltage landscape lighting only require a shallow trench, and can even be left above ground, if preferred, though this may put wiring at risk from lawn equipment. You may have difficulty selling your home if you do not have the right electrical safety certificates. However, there is a general understanding within the electrical trade of the standard duties and skills associated with residential electrical installation, upgrades and repair. The correct safety procedures to be used in troubleshooting electrical equipment will be explained in detail.</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this. When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel.
