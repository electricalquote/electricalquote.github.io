<p>6. It's important to size circuit breakers for the wire size they serve. LED fixtures fond of the open air. Low Voltage Transformers or Transverters are devices used to provide 24VAC power to the low voltage switches & controls in the building. Here's the truth: not all electrical contractors are created equal. Turn off power at your circuit breaker panel, the most important step in connecting an electrical outlet.
