We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable. Like a power strip, it provides extension outlets for your devices but its main job is to minimize the damage caused by random power fluctuations called power surges.</p>
<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>
