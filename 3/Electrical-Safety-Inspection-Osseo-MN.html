<p>Fortunately, you can protect your equipment by simply installing surge protectors where these appliances plug into your wall. When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches. A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>Everything in your home that uses power is linked to your panel box. In the hub technique, a home run is brought from the transformer to a location within a cluster of fixtures. Or, you can ask the builder if you know who that is. If all else fails, a professional electrician can help you find the panel. A new circuit breaker or service panel will give you upgraded electrical capacity throughout your home. Limit your choices to those devices that are truly essential during a power outage and you'll keep your total costs down.</p>
