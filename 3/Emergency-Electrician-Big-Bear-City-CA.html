Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
