This guide looks at things that you, as an electrician who has gained electrical experience in a foreign country, must do to become eligible for examination as an electrician in Michigan. If not, try the other receptacle, as it's likely you switched around the black wires. Once you've connected the cable, stand up the light fixture and press its pointed stake deep into the ground.</p>
