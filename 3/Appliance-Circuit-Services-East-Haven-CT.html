Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>Unlike high voltage, Class 1 wiring, Class 2 wiring need not be installed by a licensed electrician. Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings. Although lighting brings your garden and exterior amenities to life at night time, facade or feature lighting to the exterior of your home should also be considered. All your electrical appliances and components share a common factor: the breaker panel.</p>
<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second.

Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>

Keeping your computer on a surge protector allows it to turn off if it has to and if there are electric problems. That unit has over 4,000 hours now with no issues just regular maintenance.
