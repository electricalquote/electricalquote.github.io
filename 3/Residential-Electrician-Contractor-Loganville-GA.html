At Arrow Electric, Inc., we can provide you with a whole-house surge protection to insure your home and electronics from unpredictable power surges. There is no problem too big or small and we can handle all electrical panel problems with effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

Even in states that do not have contractor licensing requirements, financial incentive programs often include installer requirements, such as pre-approval or, some cases, NABCEP certification. The Generac standby generator senses outages and turns itself on within seconds when there's a utility power outage.</p>
<p>If you've never inspected your home's electrical wiring, now is the time. Our experienced master electricians will evaluate your company's unique needs to determine the proper number, type, and placement of light fixtures and switches. As it is the best you can do is either a switched outlet or an unswitched, but you cannot have both.

Needless to say this is much more than you will probably need for most of your home outdoor lighting projects.</p>
