Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible. Setting up landscape lighting is a good idea when establishing the boundaries of an outdoor path.</p>

The dim lighting means you have to use more fixtures, which creates a sort of landing strip look, or if you are using deck light fixtures they end up looking like a bunch of bug zappers, (without the ability to zap the bugs). The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>

<p>Many homes in New England have fuse boxes and electrical panels that are 50 years old or older. Low voltage landscape lighting comes in all varieties of sizes and styles.

<p>In other words - don't continue using an aging, defective electrical panel or cuicut breaker in your home. With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes. Or maybe it's something bad, like a new electrical contractor opened up in your town and hired away some of your best people. Don't run extension cords under the rug or carpet. Electricians train to handle a wide variety of issues with electrical power, lighting and control systems.</p>
