The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.” With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off.

Ultimately the generator size will be based on the total running watts and starting KVA of all the circuits, appliances and mechanical systems connected to the generator.
