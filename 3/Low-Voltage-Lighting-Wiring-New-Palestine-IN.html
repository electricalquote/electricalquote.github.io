<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>

Almost all electricians work full time, which may include evenings and weekends. There are several differences between 120 volt and 12 volt (low voltage) outdoor landscape lighting systems.
