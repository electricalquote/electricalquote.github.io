<h2>Circuit Installation And Upgrades in Independence Oregon</h2>
<p>When choosing a transformer, it's important to pick one that can handle the total wattage of your fixtures. Master Electrician: You need to hold a valid journeyman electrician license for at least 2 years with at least 12,000 hours of on-the-job training under a master electrician. Workers with proper electrical training keep plant operations and equipment running smoothly. I trust TLC, and enjoy (as much is possible with plumbing issues) working with them. Attaching the cable for the lights to the transformer is an easy task of screwing the wires in place.</p>
