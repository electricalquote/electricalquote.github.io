Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
