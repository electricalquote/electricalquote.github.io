We offer both repair and replacement services , and we'll discuss the pros and cons of each option to help you make the decision that is best for your situation. Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>

Luckily, your circuit breaker detects when there's too much electrical flow and trips” (breaks the circuit).
