Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>
<p>When your office's can lights die, or when it's time to replace your home's landscape lighting, you can trust Mr. Electric to tackle the job right the first time.
