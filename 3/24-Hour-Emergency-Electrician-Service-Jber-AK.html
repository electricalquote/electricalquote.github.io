<p>Legitimate licensing: If your state requires electricians to be licensed, check that the license is current. The technical skills of engineers and technical managers as far as the operation, maintenance and troubleshooting of such important industrial equipment are vital for the efficient and cost effective operation of the plant with minimum downturn.

In case you are looking to design or redo your home's lighting, then you might be considering to do this as a Do-It-Yourself project.

<p>The problem is that a GFCI monitors the current on the neutral and hot wires; when they are unbalanced it will trip. In new construction, GFCI receptacles are required by code where electricity and water are in close proximity, as in the bathroom, kitchen, garage, swimming pool area, crawl-space, unfinished basement, or on exterior outlets.
