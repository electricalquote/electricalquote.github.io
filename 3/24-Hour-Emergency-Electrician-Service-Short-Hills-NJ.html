<p>As of 2018, the median annual wages for electricians were $55,190, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. When someone touches an exposed wire or a piece of conductive metal connected to the circuit, the electricity can pass through the body to the ground, or between two different parts of the body. Not doing so can be a fire hazard and will break your electrical outlets. Hoover can take care of the entire process from generator installation to generator repair.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know to make an informed decision about your Generac home backup generator purchase.
