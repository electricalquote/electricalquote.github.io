Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen. If you are like most people, you are probably aware of some basic electrical knowledge, such as knowing how to flip a breaker and that water and electricity don't mix, but there's also a lot you probably don't know.</p>
<p>It is usually controlled by one circuit breaker that is distinguishable from the 110 circuit breakers because it is much larger and is located in a separate circuit breaker box. If your electrical panel is more than 40 years old it may need to be rejuvenated, replaced or upgraded. Extra protection is incorporated into the latest equipment in the form of circuit breakers.

<p>Employ only a certified electrician with training and experience in safety practices and procedures, as well as the proper equipment, to perform all major electrical installation or repair. The whole fixture is used as a heat sink for the LED to ensure it continues lighting for years to come. The electrical panel is an important and foundational part of your electrical system. For instance, if you have a Federal Pacific or Zinsco electrical panel, you should know that these were very common in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC.
