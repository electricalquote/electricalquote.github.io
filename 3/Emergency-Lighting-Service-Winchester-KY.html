The smallest generators produce around 800 watts while large industrial generators can produce 500,000 watts (500 kilowatts, or kW) or more.</p>
<p>GFCIs prevent electrical accidents by shutting the power off when an electric current is detected to be flowing through the water. If by chance someone plugs an electric heater, or something else into a receptacle outlet and it overloads the circuit, the circuit breaker will trip off.
