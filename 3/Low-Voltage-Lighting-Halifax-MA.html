The need for surge protectors only became significant in recent years as the trend to go micro also meant the minute devices modern tech and gadgets are more sensitive to surges than the pre-internet age electrical devices.

Avoid planting trees underneath power lines or near utility equipment. The electric service panel is the connection between the external wires coming from the street and the internal wires of your home's electric system. Cisco was also promoting it and installed it in their Canadian HQ as a showcase.
