<h3>Pressing Need for Lightning Protection Installation in Ames IA</h3>
<p>No matter how great your surge protection is, if lightening strikes your house, all bets are off. According to the National Institute for Burn Medicine, more than half of all burn accidents involving infants and children can be prevented by lower water heater settings. The best solution is to put all three white wires, plus an additional one about 6" long, into a wire nut. We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
