<p>Keep in mind that even certified professionals, like the Electrician in Atlanta, GA or Houston electrician, always bring tools with them whenever they do home service repair or electrical installations to ensure that they will be able to finish the job efficiently in the least possible time. Also known as electric channel raceways or plastic channels, these extruded profiles help you protect and organize all of the types of electrical wire in your home. I also suggest looking at gaining Australian experience under the supervision of a licensed electrician.</p>

Or at least, remove the fuse or trip the breaker for the specific circuit you will be working on in the service panel. That's where your circuit breaker is located, and your panel is what houses the wiring and equipment.
