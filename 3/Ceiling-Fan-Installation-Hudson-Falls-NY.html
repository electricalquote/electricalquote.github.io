Because having a grounding wire and grounded (three-pronged) outlets adds an extra level of safety, newer houses and buildings are required to have three-pronged outlets with grounding wires. I do not suggest that you remove the breaker panel cover which will show all the wiring from the circuits, but you could turn the breaker off to a room and remove the cover plates to the light switches and receptacles and loosen the screws that hold them in the electrical box.</p>
<p>The electrical switches & sockets are available in a range of colours and finishes from top brands so whether you are completely rewiring or just revamping there will be a product to suit. These light fixtures are designed to shine from underneath trees and houses.
