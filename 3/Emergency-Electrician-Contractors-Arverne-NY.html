Even with an all-LED lighting scheme running on DC circuits, the house would still need conventional 120-volt AC current for appliances and other plug-in devices. The variety of applications is significant as a result, ranging from decorative street lighting, commercial parking lot lighting, car lot lighting, outdoor landscape lighting, architectural lighting, security lighting, and general site lighting.</p>
