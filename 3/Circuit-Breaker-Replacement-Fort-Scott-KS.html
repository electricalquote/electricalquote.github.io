More information about National Electrical Safety Month, including the complete 2012 NESM Toolkit and the How Do You Know?” program can be found on ESFI's Web site at -. With all of the wires reconnected and your new wire in place, carefully tuck the wires back into the electrical box. Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>
<p>Keep cords away from sources of heat and water. You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet. When you replace fuse box with breaker panel, your home becomes safer. Do not overload outlets with multiple adaptors or power strips; relocate cords instead.
