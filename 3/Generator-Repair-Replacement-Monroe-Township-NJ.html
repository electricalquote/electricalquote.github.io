Electrician: Show 6 years of work experience, or, show substitute 2 years of experience for completing an approved training course equal to least 576 hours and passing an exam.</p>
<p>Installing new light fixtures involves a series of steps like turning off power to the applicable areas of your home, mounting the fixture, and ensuring that the wiring is properly connected.

This type of lighting gives less bright light than mains, but it is often still good enough to light up a path, bedding area, or even useful practical light if there are enough lights and they are near enough to where the light is wanted.</p>
