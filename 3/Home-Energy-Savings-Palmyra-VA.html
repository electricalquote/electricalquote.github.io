<p>A panel box upgrade is safer and gives your family more options with electrical devices and appliances.

<p>The best and the most affordable option are to go for low voltage cable lighting. From the ceiling junction box, the cable splits off, and travels to each of the other boxes in the circuit. Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond. Complete the rough-in phase of the wiring job by connecting the appropriate wires with wire connectors, adding short lengths of wire (pigtails) where they're needed and folding all the wires neatly into the boxes.</p>
<p>The least complicated to install is a light switch that operates from only one location although multiple location switches are not much more difficult to replace. You are correct to be careful about moving outlets or any other device when the existing wires are too short.
