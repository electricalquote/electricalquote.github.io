Though you will often have to set it up yourself, it serves the purpose of lighting and powering house appliances in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>More people die from carbon monoxide poisoning from the gas engines on generators than from the disasters causing the power outages. We provide installation, service and repairs on both indoor and outdoor commercial lights. If you spot an electrical danger—such as flickering or dimming lights or sparks from outlets, plugs, or cords—make sure to unplug the malfunctioning appliance immediately and get a replacement.
