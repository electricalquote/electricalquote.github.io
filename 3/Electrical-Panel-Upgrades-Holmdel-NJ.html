<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>The inspection will help identify potential sources of electrical fires, ensuring you make the changes needed to keep your home safe. Outdated electrical systems in older homes can benefit from an upgrade of light fixtures. Safety could be an issue, but some engineers argue that glass fuses offer a reasonable amount of protection.
