The Basic Electrical Wiring Certificate provides fundamental knowledge of electrical wiring and AC and DC circuits. To keep pace with today's fast-growing, innovative business climate, we strive to remain on the cutting edge of electrical installations by using the latest technology. The most basic method of supplying backup power is running a portable generator in your yard, then plugging in extension cords that plug into your appliances.</p>

The generator runs on a home's existing natural gas or LP fuel supply. We are a Generac Elite Dealer, so we have extensive experience in the series and the types of generators they offer. Electricians with further certifications may have met even more stringent performance and customer service guidelines, so you know you are receiving the highest quality electrical service.</p>
