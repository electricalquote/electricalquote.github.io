Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations.

A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>

This poses a safety issue because many old circuit breakers won't trip when they are called upon to. This could be a potential fire hazard as heat builds up possibly breaking down components of your wiring and leading to a fire.</p>
<p>Keeping the lights closer to the transformer will help eliminate the voltage drop that occurs when lights are further away. The 24-hour service team at Blind & Sons is prepared to offer superior care at affordable prices, so never hesitate to call for any of your electrical needs.
