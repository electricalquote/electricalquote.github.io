If you hear any popping, crackling, sizzling, or buzzing coming from your outlets, switches, or appliances, there could be a serious problem. Backup house generators often differ in what fuel source they use to generator their power. For example, if a circuit breaker repeatedly trips after being reset, electricians determine the cause and fix it.</p>
<p>A permanently installed home backup generator protects your home automatically and sits outside just like a central air conditioning unit.
