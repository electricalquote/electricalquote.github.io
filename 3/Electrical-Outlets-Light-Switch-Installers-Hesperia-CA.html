Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>
<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately. The journeyman electrician exam will determine whether or not electrician training has been fruitful. If your house still contains a fuse panel, you should upgrade to a standard breaker panel.

If your home is older, it may have a fused-based electrical system.</p>
<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling.
