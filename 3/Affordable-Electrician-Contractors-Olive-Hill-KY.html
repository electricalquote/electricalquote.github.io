<h2>How To Hire Master Electrician in Olive Hill</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>Our photo (left) shows an electrical receptacle that is being wired to a single circuit. Instead, you want to shop for surge protectors that are built strictly for computer hardware applications. And like all technicians, our licensed electricians are vigorously background checked to ensure you only get the most trusted, best electricians to help you with all your electrical needs. Direct other questions about licensing and examinations directly to the Electrical Administrative Office of the Bureau of Construction Codes.</p>

<p>Stab-lock connections are the number one cause of electrical service repair calls. Georgia and a few other states waive licensing as long as the residential electrician works for a licensed contractor. You don't just want to go with the first cheap computer surge protector you can find. Low voltage lighting systems usually use LED bulbs because they are energy efficient and draw a small amount of current. However, propane gas or natural gas generators consume more fuel per kilowatt of power produced than diesel generators.</p>
