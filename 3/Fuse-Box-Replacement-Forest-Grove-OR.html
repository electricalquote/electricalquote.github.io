Power Plus provides varying scopes of service to maintain the uptime and reliability of your switchgear and ATS equipment. The smallest generators produce around 800 watts while large industrial generators can produce 500,000 watts (500 kilowatts, or kW) or more.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible.
