<p>KOHLER generators deliver clean, safe and stable power that meets strict utility requirements. Remember how you removed the old light fixture and you will be reversing these steps to install your new one. The solar panels that typical lighting fixtures use need to be small.

A resistance measurement of.005 ohms from ground point of the generator or battery to ground terminal of any electrical device may be considered satisfactory.
