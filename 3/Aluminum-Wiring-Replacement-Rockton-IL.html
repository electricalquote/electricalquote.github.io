<p>Illuminate the night with amazing, stylish and affordable landscape lighting. Our experienced project managers and electricians know how important installing the correct lighting is to the success of your commercial space. After installation, our generators are tested and ready to go. Best of all, low-voltage deck light systems don't require you to take the precautions necessary with household 120-volt systems because they are not powerful enough to give you a serious shock.</p>
<p>Managed Whole House Coverage - You can get more coverage with less generator, up to whole house coverage, by pairing a smaller generator with one of Generac's Nexus load shedding switch options.
