While it's true that circuit breakers and fuses perform the same general function — which is to short circuit or disrupt overloaded electrical currents — it doesn't mean that they provide the equal amount of protection against electrical hazards in your home.

Our Virginia Beach electricians are prepared to walk you through and conduct every step of the selection and installation process if you are looking to purchase or replace a generator. Avoid overloading double adapters or power boards with too many appliances as this can cause fires.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of outages gives stationary, permanently installed standby generators a clear advantage over their portable, gas-powered kin, which resemble big lawn-mower engines on dollies. Supervision Electrician: You need to show proofs of 4 years of experience as a licensed journey worker electrician. Purchasing a generator from Electric Generators Direct provides you with the same service options as if you were to purchase one from your local home improvement warehouse.</p>
<p>Output Volt-Amps (VA) is a measurement of electrical power and is used to size a UPS system for the equipment that will be connected to it. Plus, bigger boxes just make wiring easier, especially if they're crammed full of wires and connectors. The key to planning a successful landscape lighting system is understanding voltage drop and how it affects your layout. Even for work outside of home renovation, electrical services may be required.

Sometimes your transformer will also have a green wire that should be attached to ground”. This grounding wire neutralizes any dangerous electrical current into the ground. A key smart maintenance tip: Hire in a professional electrician annually to check your electrical systems, just as you would get a checkup for your personal health.</p>
