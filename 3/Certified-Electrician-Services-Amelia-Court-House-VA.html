Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more ‘layers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed.

<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Take note that appliances have also been a common cause of fire, so proper usage guidelines should be followed and electrical overloads should be avoided.

Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible. Finally, some households overuse power cords. Installing a low-voltage lighting system is both safe and inexpensive.</p>
