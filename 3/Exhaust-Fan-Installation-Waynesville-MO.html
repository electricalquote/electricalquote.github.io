A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.</p>
