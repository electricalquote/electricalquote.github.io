If you are in the process of building a new home, our licensed electrician contractors can help to lay the groundwork for reliable wiring in the early stages. Moreover, it's advisable to install the generator as close as possible to its fuel supply and the transfer switch.

<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
<p>In these systems light switches control lighting contactors , a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit. Spending a little bit of money now on a good surge protection device can save you a lot of money in the future when your equipment fails.
