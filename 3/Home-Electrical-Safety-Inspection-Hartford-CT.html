However, there is a general understanding within the electrical trade of the standard duties and skills associated with residential electrical installation, upgrades and repair. The correct safety procedures to be used in troubleshooting electrical equipment will be explained in detail.</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this. When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel. Water - Before using an extension cord outside or in a wet area, confirm that the cord is rated for outdoor use and make sure the cord is connected to a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.</p>
<p>This means that 12-gauge wire will work for your landscape lighting system. Outdoor landscape lights are used to highlight trees, gardens, fountains, walkways and anything else that you want to call attention to. Not only are these lights beautiful in their own right, but they also increase general nighttime visibility, which improves safety and discourages would-be intruders. The Electrical Safety Foundation International found that each day, seven children must be treated for injuries caused by electrical shock.</p>
<p>In these systems light switches control lighting contactors , a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit. Spending a little bit of money now on a good surge protection device can save you a lot of money in the future when your equipment fails. JMC has a priority to deliver quality, service, design and installation at a cost-effective price and to provide a personalized and innovative service to fulfill our client's specific requirements at all times.</p>
