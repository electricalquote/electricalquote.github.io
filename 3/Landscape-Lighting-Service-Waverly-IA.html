A Surge Essentials plan from Direct Energy® delivers coverage for your kitchen appliances, home electronics and even mobile devices. We can schedule a consultation or install or repair your lighting as needed per your project requirements. If you've read our long article on electricity , you'll know that an electric current is a flow of electrons (tiny particles inside atoms ) carrying energy through a metal or another substance in a loop called a circuit.</p>

<p>If it immediately trips, the problem is probably in the circuit's wiring; you'll need an electrician. That's why our team of highly-trained electricians are standing by to help. If the continuity check on the load side of the contactor is shorted phase-to-phase, phase-to-ground or open phase-to-phase, then follow the power circuit to the motor. Electrical boxes should be mounted 18” to center off the floor for outlets. If the outlet you're replacing is at the end of the circuit, it wouldn't have the extra pair of black and white wires, since it doesn't need to continue the circuit, so you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and one ground wire in that case.</p>
