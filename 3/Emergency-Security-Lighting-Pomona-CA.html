<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>
<p>A line of switches on the wall can detract from the room's style. Low-voltage landscape lighting for the backyard needs only an outdoor receptacle and a transformer. After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses. Your electrical services provider will know all the safety precautions they need to take and can even identify potential problems before they take hold.</p>
