CliftonLarsonAllen provided three years of benchmark data for electrical and mechanical contractors. If only some of the lights at your home are out, you may not see the point of calling an electrical company. There is also a ton of information on residential LED lighting within the Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting ( PEARL ). Especially useful is the Solid State Lighting division.</p>

Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
