<p>Although upgrading your electric panel can bring a sizeable bill, it is far less than the cost caused by an electrical fire, or the losses from a home insurance non-payout. The breakers or fuses in your panel regulate that electricity. The transformer is very important when embarking on a lighting project. In this technique, a home run from the transformer is brought to the center fixture of a group that typically uses 12-gauge or larger wire. Before you get ready to install your lights, make sure you have all the tools and accessories required.</p>
