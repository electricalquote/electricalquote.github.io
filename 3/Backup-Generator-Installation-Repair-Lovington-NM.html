<p>Power generators have two main components. If they look OK, then you'd use your DMM to see if there's power to them, and, of course, on the motor side of each one. Maintain your whole house generator regularly by having a scheduled maintenance routine to ensure it lasts long enough. To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals. Add a few feet for each fixture so you have some slack and the ability to relocate the fixtures slightly.</p>

This helps protect people from being shocked, and it prevents fires due to electrical faults. Bill Locklin the inventor of the original 12 volt garden lighting system in the mid 1950's knew better than anyone how potentially dangerous 12 volts can be and in some cases even more dangerous than 120 volt main power.

At 100,000 hours of expected life, you'll probably never have to change the bulbs in your lifetime, which is good, because you can't really change the bulbs in a lot of these fixtures.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
