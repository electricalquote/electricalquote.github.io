<p>Commercial Generator Services: We will install, repair, replace, or service commercial generators and standby power systems. Electric panels are connected to the service meter or the electrical disconnect. Light bulbs are the most prolific electrical device in our homes, making sure they are used correctly is important.

To find out if you have a neutral wire to work with, you need to take the light switch out of the wall box and look inside for a neutral wire. 5.
