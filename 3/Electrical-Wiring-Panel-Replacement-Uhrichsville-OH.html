<p>All splicing of ground wires and other wires must be completed with approved splicing devices when calling for inspection. Suppose that our voltage check shows that the voltage did not reach the coil when it should have in the sequence of operation of the control circuit. When you're sure the breaker is off, remove the cover plate and unscrew the switch. A plan will insure that you buy the correct amount of materials and fixtures, so don't avoid this one (unless you are only going to be installing one post light and even then you want to know how much wire to buy).</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity.

We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>
