<p>However, you are approaching the age threshold and we would recommend having an annual electrical inspection performed by either a certified home inspector or a licensed electrician. While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>You can find many outdoor light fixtures that will enhance these type houses. Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death. For the rest of the weeks that you need power, you can deduct the 3500 dollars for the cost of the generators but that still leaves you with a $350 bill per week to operate them.</p>

If you were to open your electrical panel or breaker box, which you'll typically find in your basement, garage, utility room, or a closet, you'll see rows of switches.
