<p>First things first: A backup generator is an electrical system that allows homes to maintain power on some (or all) appliances during an outage. Always use a registered electrician to install new appliances. Shoes - Avoid damp or wet areas when using electrical power tools outdoors. Our licensed electricians have the experience and knowledge needed to install smoke detectors and make recommendations so that you and your family can feel protected from possible fire hazards.</p>

Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.

The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
