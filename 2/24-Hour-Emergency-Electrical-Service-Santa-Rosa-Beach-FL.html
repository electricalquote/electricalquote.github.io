<p>Electricians install, maintain and repair electric power in rural, residential and commercial areas. Apprenticeship Electrician: Must be at least 18 years old and pass an exam. But if there is the slightest danger that wires will be nicked by someone driving a nail into a stud though which the wires are run be sure to use steel plates to protect the wire where it passes through the studs. Let a licensed electrician deal with electrical issues. However, you probably don't even notice that at this moment, many of your electronic devices are experiencing a voltage spike.</p>
<p>Typical off the shelf models, called "point of use" protectors are the most common and are designed to safely protect only a few devices at a time. It is better to install both types, external protection, as mentioned above; and point-of-use protection, which is a single surge protector that plugs into an outlet. If you aren't sure of normal circuit wire size, use the #15 ampere Type-S time-delay fuse. A more advanced industrial electrician will be strongly involved in the control wiring and operation of process equipment.</p>
