You can get generators in a wide range of sizes, the largest being for massive power plants that can be used for ages and generate huge amounts of electricity, to small domesticated ones that can generate enough power to home or business. Inside your house, you have a complex web of electrical wires just like you do veins in your own body.</p>

This is safe enough for indoor installations using wall outlets, for example, to power a lamp in your living room or a video game console.
