To contract for profit or reward, including sub-contracting, a Registered Electrical Contractors registration must be also held. Under the Trades Qualification and Apprenticeship Act the minimum education required is a completed grade 10. However, in the unionized sector of the electrical industry most programs require grade 12 with Math, English and Physics.</p>
