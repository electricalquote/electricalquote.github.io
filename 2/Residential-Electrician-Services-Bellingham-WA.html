<h3>Breaker & Fuse Box Repair & Replacement Bellingham WA 98225</h3>
<p>Fuse boxes; especially those that were installed prior to 1960, need to be upgraded to circuit breakers for added safety. Even with an all-LED lighting scheme running on DC circuits, the house would still need conventional 120-volt AC current for appliances and other plug-in devices. The variety of applications is significant as a result, ranging from decorative street lighting, commercial parking lot lighting, car lot lighting, outdoor landscape lighting, architectural lighting, security lighting, and general site lighting.</p>
<p>Fuses are outdated and don't trip like the circuit breakers. Generators help supply homes with a continuous flow of power in the case of an outage, allowing homeowners to still run appliances like air conditioners, security systems, refrigerators, heaters and lights while the power is down. Safety - Simply put, if you aren't completely sure of what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it. Your home or business's electricity is not something you want to mess with.</p>
