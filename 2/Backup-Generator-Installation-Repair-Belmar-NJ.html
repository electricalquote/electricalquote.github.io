<p>Not all UL listed SPDs are necessarily rated for use with a lightning protection system. Surges can be caused by birds, small animals, falling trees, or vehicles crashing into power poles, but the most obvious is lightning. Voltage indicators are pen-like pocket tools used to check for the presence of AC voltage over 50 volts. On this particular receptacle box, the black wires go with the gold screws.

<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
