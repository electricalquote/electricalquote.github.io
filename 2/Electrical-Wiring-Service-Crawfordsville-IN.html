It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>

Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible. Setting up landscape lighting is a good idea when establishing the boundaries of an outdoor path.</p>
