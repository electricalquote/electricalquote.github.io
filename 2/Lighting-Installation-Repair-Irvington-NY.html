<p>Fuse boxes; especially those that were installed prior to 1960, need to be upgraded to circuit breakers for added safety. Even with an all-LED lighting scheme running on DC circuits, the house would still need conventional 120-volt AC current for appliances and other plug-in devices. The variety of applications is significant as a result, ranging from decorative street lighting, commercial parking lot lighting, car lot lighting, outdoor landscape lighting, architectural lighting, security lighting, and general site lighting.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting design is very similar to the design of the landscape itself. There are generators that will run on diesel fuel but these will mainly be larger and for more industrial use than for the home. Avoid installing lights on top of railings or posts where they might shine in people's eyes and pose a safety hazard. Journeyman License: 4-year experience in such activities as installation and repair of electrical wiring, systems, and equipment is required.</p>

<p>The diagram above shows a two conductor cable from the circuit breaker panel going to a wall switch. Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>
