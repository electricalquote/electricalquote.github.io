<p>Although it is permitted to wire lights and receptacles on the same circuit I usually avoid doing that for the sake of the people living in the home. You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same. Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger.

<p>Solar lights generally function for 8 to 10 hours. Two cables entering an outlet box indicate that the outlet is not the last fixture on a circuit.
