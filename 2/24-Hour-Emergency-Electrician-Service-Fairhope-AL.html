<p>Decide where you will plan to use landscape fixtures and the type of light you expect them to provide - uplighting, silhouetting, grazing lighting, wall washing, etc. While this is often sold to new installers as an easy-to-install method, it results in decreased efficiency (higher electrical costs due to resistance created by small-gauge cable pre-attached to the fixtures) and the drain of your transformer's power capacity. 3.

<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do.

<h3>What Does a Fairhope AL Residential Electrician Do?</h3>
<p>It is good to be aware of the signs that you could have an electrical emergency in your Austin, TX home. Those who choose to become electricians can pursue a great deal of hands-on training while in the military, as well as courses designed to further their knowledge. The easiest landscape lighting to place in the backyard is solar lighting (below). Rectangular cross-section metal or PVC wire troughs (North America) or trunking (UK) may be used if many circuits are required.</p>
<p>A common problem is a switch that does nothing or an electrical outlet that is not functional. Experience: Typically, a residential electrician uses single phase power supplies - 120 or 240 volts. Lay the wires alongside the lights - but do not attach yet. The BLS reports that jobs for electrical contractors are expected to increase 23 percent between 2010 and 2020.
