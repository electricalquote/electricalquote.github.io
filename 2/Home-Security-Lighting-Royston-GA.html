Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
<p>All backup generators we carry are backed with a guaranteed written warranty for parts and labor. This should not come as a surprise, as practically everything in the modern world requires the use of systems that electrical engineers design and develop.
