<p>About the only electrical code restriction for a low voltage system is that the transformer be connected to a GFCI protected receptacle or circuit, when installed in locations that require GFCI protection (see Common GFCI Location Requirements ). When it comes to household electricity, there's a lot more to consider than simply turning a switch On and Off. This applies especially to landlords, who would breach the law if the tenants' health is jeopardised by unlicensed electrical repairs.</p>
<p>11. Connect the low-voltage wire at the end post to the transformer near an electrical outlet. A maximum of 1,000 hours of related education or power lineman experience can be included as part of the experience.
