<p>Parallel wiring is the standard for 120 volt circuits in the entire house, making possible the independent use of all appliances, supplied by the same voltage. That is why it is said that electricity is always looking for a path to ground (lower potential). Reach out to the professionals at All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating to learn more about our comprehensive electrical services and how they can help your home run more efficiently. The source for the circuit is at the switch and 2-wire cable runs to each receptacle outlet.</p>

Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.

It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of outages gives stationary, permanently installed standby generators a clear advantage over their portable, gas-powered kin, which resemble big lawn-mower engines on dollies.
