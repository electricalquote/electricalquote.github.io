When it comes to household electricity, there's a lot more to consider than simply turning a switch On and Off. This applies especially to landlords, who would breach the law if the tenants' health is jeopardised by unlicensed electrical repairs.</p>

Given that, I'd check the wiring at both switch and outlet. One of the first things to consider when installing a generator in your home is what type of fuel source you want it to run on. When choosing a fuel source, the choice between natural gas and propane often depends on the location of the home.</p>
