<p>Upgrading an electrical panel is a serious endeavor that must be handled by a professional; this is not a DIY task. With todays technology, high voltage for landscape lighting is useless. Propane-fueled generators are often smaller than other types, and larger-sized models can be costly to acquire and run. The box with the switch in it thus has a "hot" wire, permanently hot, a neutral and a ground. The location of the switched receptacle is not specified either. We can deliver you the high quality preventative maintenance services you need to have peace of mind in knowing that your home's electrical system is always in the best condition possible.</p>
<p>Output Volt-Amps (VA) is a measurement of electrical power and is used to size a UPS system for the equipment that will be connected to it. Plus, bigger boxes just make wiring easier, especially if they're crammed full of wires and connectors. The key to planning a successful landscape lighting system is understanding voltage drop and how it affects your layout. Even for work outside of home renovation, electrical services may be required.
