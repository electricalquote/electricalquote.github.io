When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible.

Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>
<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought.

Our team of licensed electricians also handle generator repair and maintenance to ensure that your unit is functioning properly at all times.</p>
