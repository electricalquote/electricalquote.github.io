Backyard ponds benefit from underwater lights , while in-ground well lights provide an elegant, warm glow. If you are looking for a truly unique track lighting system, our Longmont electricians can help design a customized monorail fixture for you. Your lighting system or transformer should be plugged into a GFCI circuit breaker for moisture protection.</p>

If your business's backup generator is leaking fuel, not turning on, or isn't functioning as it should, contact Jaffe Electric online or call (301) 253-3778 for commercial generator repair in Maryland and throughout the DC and Northern Virginia area.
