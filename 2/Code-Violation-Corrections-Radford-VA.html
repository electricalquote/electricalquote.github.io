Be wary of any electrical contractor who agrees to do any major electrical work, such as rewiring a house, without pulling the proper local building permits.

When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
