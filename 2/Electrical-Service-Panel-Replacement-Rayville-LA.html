<p>The panel is also set to shut off overloaded circuit breakers to prevent damaging appliances or machines and to prevent any risk of fire. This type of electrical panel has fuses that burn out, then need replacement. With our thorough electrical safety inspections , we'll be able to identify any problems or issues your system may have and repair them properly. At this point, use a voltage tester to see if the power is truly off to the light switch before you go any further.</p>
<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
