Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity.

The generator offers a power capacity of 15,300 watts on natural gas and 17,000 watts on liquid propane.
