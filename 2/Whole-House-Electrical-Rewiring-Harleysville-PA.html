Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity.

<p>The lights run for a lot longer than traditional incandescent bulbs and are more energy efficient. Too much of a single color becomes visually overwhelming and boring, so electrical switches can provide needed contrast that carries the eye through the room with a unified, designer touch. The generator offers a power capacity of 15,300 watts on natural gas and 17,000 watts on liquid propane.

When you turn on a power hog like an air conditioner or your computer it creates a power surge to "kick start" it. This can cause internal damage to the equipment.</p>
