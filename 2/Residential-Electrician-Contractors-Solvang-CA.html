Many designers will only create a fixture placement plan when it comes to landscape lighting. With a trusted generator, you'll be covered in case of a power outage. 4. Perform basic circuit checks for shorts, opens and ground faults using a multimeter.</p>
<p>However, one question that most drivers ask is how easy HID lights can be installed.

Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
