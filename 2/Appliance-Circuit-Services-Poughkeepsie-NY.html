<p>Although it may seem easy to attach a few wires and flip a switch, it is imperative that the procedure is done properly to avoid danger. Lastly, find out about his or her past lighting education and participation in any lighting design awards programs. Homeowners may want to consider upgrading their wiring to accept three-pronged outlets, particularly if you are replacing older outlets that may be cracked, damaged or covered in paint. Here's why you need a licensed electrician to take care you your residential and commercial electrical needs.</p>
<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter outlet, or GFCI, is a circuit breaker outlet. Electrical Contractor: You need to complete 4,000 hours of work as a journeyman electrician with 2,000 hours specializing in commercial work. No idea if the existing light has a xformer separate from the fixture, or if it's built in. The install is on the first floor, no attic space. Thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge when used for controlling low-voltage lighting relays or thermostats, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls.</p>
