<p>If you notice that your lights frequently dim, especially when you use appliances like microwaves, hair dryers, and air conditioners, your electrical panel may need to be replaced. The hot and neutral wires run from your electrical panel to the device that needs power. It is now code required to also have a neutral conductor at the switch for the use of electronic devices such as smart switches to control the light. Portable generators, true to their name, are easily movable, can be taken from location to location (such as camping trips) and are easily stored in an outdoor shed or garage.</p>
<p>More people die from carbon monoxide poisoning from the gas engines on generators than from the disasters causing the power outages. We provide installation, service and repairs on both indoor and outdoor commercial lights. If you spot an electrical danger—such as flickering or dimming lights or sparks from outlets, plugs, or cords—make sure to unplug the malfunctioning appliance immediately and get a replacement.
