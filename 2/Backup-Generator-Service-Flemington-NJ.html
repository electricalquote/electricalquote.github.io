Circuit breakers are very easy to reset in the case they are tripped, and they also may be used with a GFCI style breaker for added protection from electrical faults.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere.
