As your wiring ages and starts to deteriorate then you might see the flickering of lights, experience shock while touching an appliance, find a burning smell near appliances or see any faded black marks around the panel. Proper installation of a home generator begins with an assessment of the households needs and the proper choice of generator.</p>
<p>There is an increasing need for surge protectors because high-powered devices are more sensitive when it comes to voltage spikes. A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system.
