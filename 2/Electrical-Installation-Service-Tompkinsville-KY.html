<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected. This is the preferred method of wiring a half-hot switched outlet, because if the power is coming from the switch, it is most likely a lighting circuit that is intended to operate lights, not outlets.</p>
<p>To work in Utah, electricians should be licensed by the Department of Commerce, Professional Licensing, and Division of Occupational. Not only can large surges cause immediate damage, but smaller surges that produce mini bursts of electrical energy can slowly degrade your appliances over time and shorten their lifespan. Seating areas benefit from moon lighting or lighting installed high overhead because there are no harsh bulbs at eye level and it creates a cozy, intimate feel.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
