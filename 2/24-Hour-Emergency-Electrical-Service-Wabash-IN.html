<p>With a properly planned electrical maintenance schedule and a reliable contractor, you should never have the need to attempt to replace your old wiring or something like that, because that would be a dangerous thing to attempt a DIY on. If you know you've had a serious electrical event (like lighting blew out a transformer down the street), it's probably worth replacing your surge protector just in case. Loose or broken wires that are still slightly touching will allow the light switch to function.</p>

<p>Home generators run on diesel, gasoline, propane or natural gas.
