The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs.

Except for farm wiring in some locations, a person or company acting as an electrical contractor in Michigan must be licensed by the State or in some cases the governmental jurisdiction in which the business is located or the person resides.</p>
