<h3>Electrical Safety For Homes And Small Businesses Southington CT 06489</h3>
<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>An alternative to this approach is to install one remote transformer that can power multiple lights. Cords can create tripping hazards and may be damaged if you walk on them. Sterlite Power won two projects in Brazil, making it the first Indian transmission infrastructure developer to enter the global market.
