The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>
<p>This may even be more expensive than your initial light installation costs. Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them. The electrical panel of your home is considered the control center behind every single electric exchange in the house. Many home handymen are quite competent when it comes to installing a new or extra electrical outlet (receptacle) or group of light fixtures in their homes.</p>

To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals. Add a few feet for each fixture so you have some slack and the ability to relocate the fixtures slightly.</p>
