Your circuit breaker panel is truly the hub of your electrical system, and you can't get by without one. You can improve how the trees, fountains, and others look by highlighting your property.</p>
<p>If you want to install lighting fixtures in your garden or yard and design it so that it requires a constant flow of current, you need to have a current transformer that will measure the electrical current that comes into the device and distribute it to whatever lighting fixture that is connected to it.

The purpose of a breaker is to protect an electrical circuit from damage due to excessive current.
