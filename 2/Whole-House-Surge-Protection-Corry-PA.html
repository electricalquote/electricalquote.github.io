Smaller portable generators may be enough for a fridge and a few electronics, but larger ones can compete for capacity with mid-range standby generators. By designing your own system, you can pick out different styles and types of lighting such as, spot lights on the house and lower intensity lighting for pathways etc.</p>

In the event of an unprecedented occurrence such as a severe thunderstorm or hurricane, electricity is often the first thing to go. When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
