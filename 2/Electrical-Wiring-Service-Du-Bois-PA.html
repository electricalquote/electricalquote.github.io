<h3>New Construction Electrical Design & Installation in Du Bois PA</h3>
<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>The best and the most affordable option are to go for low voltage cable lighting. From the ceiling junction box, the cable splits off, and travels to each of the other boxes in the circuit. Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond. Complete the rough-in phase of the wiring job by connecting the appropriate wires with wire connectors, adding short lengths of wire (pigtails) where they're needed and folding all the wires neatly into the boxes.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
