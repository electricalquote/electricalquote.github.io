<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>
<p>This may even be more expensive than your initial light installation costs. Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them. The electrical panel of your home is considered the control center behind every single electric exchange in the house.
