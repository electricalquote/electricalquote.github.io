<p>At Fox & Sons, we provide circuit breaker services and electrical renovation. For example, if your lights consume 100 watts of power, you'll need a power supply that's rated for at least 120 watts (100 x 1.2). If you're planning on adding more lights in the future, buy a transformer that's rated for more wattage than you currently need. Fortunately, with the help of an emergency electrician, you can get back to normal quickly. Completely wireless and battery powered, Generac's Wireless Monitor provides you with instant status information without ever leaving the house.</p>
<p>Common subjects that electricians study during their classroom education include blueprints, math, electrical theory, work safety and the National Electrical Code. Or, you must meet the qualifications to be licensed as a journeyman electrician with 8,000 hours of journeyman experience. So, using the 200 watts from our earlier example, we'll add 25%: 200 x.25 = 50. Now, we have 200 watts for our light fixtures and 50 watts for our wiring, for a total of 250 watts.</p>
