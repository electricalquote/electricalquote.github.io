A standby generator, or automatic standby generator , is a type of system that turns on whenever you lose power, rather than waiting for you to hit the switch. To start, the wiring from the outlet to the switch does not seem to carry the ground over; I can see it terminated at the end of the sheath right where it comes into the light switch box.</p>

Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them. The electrical panel of your home is considered the control center behind every single electric exchange in the house.
