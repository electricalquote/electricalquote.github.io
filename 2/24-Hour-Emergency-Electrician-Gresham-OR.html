<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>

Under the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act an electrical apprenticeship is 9000 hours (approximately five years).
