Check that extension cords are correctly rated for the amount of electricity they are to carry and are Underwriter Laboratory (UL) approved. It is also responsible for switching the lights off when the room is empty and turn these on upon sensing the presence of an occupant. A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>
