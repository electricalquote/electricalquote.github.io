A new circuit breaker or service panel will give you upgraded electrical capacity throughout your home. Limit your choices to those devices that are truly essential during a power outage and you'll keep your total costs down.</p>

This type of electrical panel has fuses that burn out, then need replacement.

At this point, use a voltage tester to see if the power is truly off to the light switch before you go any further.</p>
