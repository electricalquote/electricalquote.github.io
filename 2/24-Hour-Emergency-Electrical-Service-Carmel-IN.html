Climbing a tree in contact with a power line can energize the tree with electricity and lead to electric shock or death. With a magnetic power system we are harnessing the internal force of the magnets to generate electricity. I like 12v landscape wired lighting far better then the new LED wireless lights, and I figured I'd share some of the problems I ran into that you can avoid :) Thanks for the read and the vote Kristen.</p>
<p>If your home seems dark and gloomy or like it just came out of a scene from a scary movie, it might be time to consider adding some outdoor lighting. Or you can buy big 5-kw banks that cost $5,000 and will keep a few critical circuits in the house going for several hours or days (if used sparingly). It runs from the transformer to each light fixture in the system.

<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
