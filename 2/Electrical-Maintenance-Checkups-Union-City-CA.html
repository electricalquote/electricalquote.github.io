<p>Fortunately, you can protect your equipment by simply installing surge protectors where these appliances plug into your wall. When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches. A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) reports there are an average of 50,000 home electrical fires each year, causing $1.3 billion in property damage and almost 1,400 injuries and 500 deaths. Intermediate to Advanced - Electrical Repairs and Circuit Wiring is Best Performed by a Certified Electrician or Licensed Electrical Contractor. The Twisted pair variety of cables comprises of a set of insulated color coded copper wires which are twisted together to form a single cable.</p>
<p>Replacing broken and damaged wiring and outlets will not only make things work better, it will also make your home safer.

Terminate the black wire from your new 3-wire cable on one of the screws on the side of the switch, and the red on the other. The average lifespan of an electrical panel is 25 years. Inspect portable cord-and-plug connected equipment, extension cords, power bars, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before each use.</p>
<p>But electricity is responsible for an average of 70 deaths and 350,000 serious injuries in the UK every year, so it's important you take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from electrical dangers. To enable you to minimize the risk to your appliances and home equipment from possible power surges caused by sudden and unexpected increases in voltage fluctuation, GreyStone Power is offering our SurgeMaster Plus program.
