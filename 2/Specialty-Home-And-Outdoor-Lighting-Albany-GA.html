You can do the maintenance yourself if you are familiar with the component and the working principle of an AC and if you have enough time.</p>

The surge protector passes the surge along from the device to the system ground. It's important to note that surge protectors don't give you complete protection.</p>

The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
