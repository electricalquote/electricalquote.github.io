If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
