<p>Another term you may come across when shopping for your fixtures is "low voltage" or "line voltage". One of the largest electrical draws in buildings are the lighting systems. Yet, regardless of their core markets, electrical contractors share quite some similar challenges and opportunities. We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable. Like a power strip, it provides extension outlets for your devices but its main job is to minimize the damage caused by random power fluctuations called power surges.</p>
<p>If your home seems dark and gloomy or like it just came out of a scene from a scary movie, it might be time to consider adding some outdoor lighting. Or you can buy big 5-kw banks that cost $5,000 and will keep a few critical circuits in the house going for several hours or days (if used sparingly). It runs from the transformer to each light fixture in the system. Whether you are installing security lighting to improve the safety of your property or looking for a new chandelier to elevate the entry to your space, we have over 30 years of experience making your dreams a reality.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing quality electrical services to families and businesses located in the greater Kirkwood area.

<p>Whether you're installing new appliances or remodeling your home, you may need to repair or install new electrical switches or outlets. 1. Layout the fixtures on the ground first so you get the layout you want. If you answered yes to our questions above, or find that your current panel doesn't meet modern home electricity requirements, you may decide it's time for an upgrade. If we need to repair damaged wires, replace non-NEC compliant wires, or otherwise upgrade your dated two-prong to three-prong wall outlets, we can perform all of these services while we're at your home to repair your electrical panel.</p>
