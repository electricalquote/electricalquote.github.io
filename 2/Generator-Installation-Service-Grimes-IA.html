<p>The diagram above shows a two conductor cable from the circuit breaker panel going to a wall switch. Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>
<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately.

Anything Electric approaches every Roswell lighting repair with the highest level of professionalism. Don't be tempted to tape damaged cords.
