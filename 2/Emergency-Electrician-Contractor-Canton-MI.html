<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Contractor in Canton</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use.

It supports both natural gas and liquid propane, so you can choose whichever fuel you are comfortable with. The attached spring will then disconnect the electrical circuit.
