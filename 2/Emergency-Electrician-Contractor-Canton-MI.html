It supports both natural gas and liquid propane, so you can choose whichever fuel you are comfortable with. The attached spring will then disconnect the electrical circuit.

Narrow beamed lighting that highlights sharp features and wide angled flood lighting to pick up flat surfaces are preferred.</p>
