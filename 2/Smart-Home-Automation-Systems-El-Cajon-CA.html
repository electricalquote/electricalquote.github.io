<p>Parking Lot Lighting - Parking lot lights are necessary for lighting and security. 5 common mistakes made while installing outdoor lighting. Most do it yourselfers will buy a low voltage outdoor lighting kit the first time around, and it's not a bad choice, but beware of the connectors you get in the kit. Canopy Lighting - Canopy lights are large fixtures designed to effectively light a space for navigation and safety such as parking lots or gas stations.

Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
