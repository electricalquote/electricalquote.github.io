There are different types of electrical lights as well as different types of power sources, such generators, to power important equipment if the power does go out.</p>
<p>A line of switches on the wall can detract from the room's style. Low-voltage landscape lighting for the backyard needs only an outdoor receptacle and a transformer. After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses. Your electrical services provider will know all the safety precautions they need to take and can even identify potential problems before they take hold.</p>
