When you finally do find the best surge protector, and you plug it into your home's outlet, you'll know that anything you plug into it will be kept safe from even the strongest of power surges.

<p>I pig-tailed my hots, neutrals, & grounds (well crimped & trimmed all but 1), which obviously gives you longer wire to work with the receptacle, but it also made tucking the rest of the wire into the receptacle easier. The registration requirement applies to beginning electricians, electrical apprentices, industrial electrical apprentices, and residential electrical apprentices. Go to a supply house and buy large transformers and quality metal fixtures, not the plastic junk normally asociated with low voltage.</p>
