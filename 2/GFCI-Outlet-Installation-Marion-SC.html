<p>I pig-tailed my hots, neutrals, & grounds (well crimped & trimmed all but 1), which obviously gives you longer wire to work with the receptacle, but it also made tucking the rest of the wire into the receptacle easier.

Go to a supply house and buy large transformers and quality metal fixtures, not the plastic junk normally asociated with low voltage.</p>
