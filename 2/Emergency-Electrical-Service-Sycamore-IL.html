<p>Low-voltage landscape lighting is a simple improvement that can make a huge difference in how your home looks after dusk and in its safety and security as well. So before the next threat of severe storms and power outages, give us a call to get a backup generator installed for your home. The Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation wants to make sure that individuals who have military experience and training and who wish to obtain a electricians license receive appropriate credit for their military training and experience.</p>
<p>Replacing broken and damaged wiring and outlets will not only make things work better, it will also make your home safer. Under the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act an electrical apprenticeship is 9000 hours (approximately five years). Terminate the black wire from your new 3-wire cable on one of the screws on the side of the switch, and the red on the other. The average lifespan of an electrical panel is 25 years. Inspect portable cord-and-plug connected equipment, extension cords, power bars, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before each use.</p>
<p>Once the backup generator senses the utility power is back on, your home is automatically transferred to the utility power. One of the best ways to safeguard your work, your refrigerated food and your comfort is with a home backup generator installed by Conductive Electrical Contracting. You should check your house for electrical safety at least once every ten years, or if you have recently moved into a new home. Standby generators use an automatic transfer switch (ATS) that connects your generator to your electrical system.</p>
