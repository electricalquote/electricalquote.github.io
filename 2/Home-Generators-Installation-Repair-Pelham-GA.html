<p>Plated copper wire tinned copper wire is relatively common in older homes, and it looks like aluminum wire. Check that extension cords are correctly rated for the amount of electricity they are to carry and are Underwriter Laboratory (UL) approved. It is also responsible for switching the lights off when the room is empty and turn these on upon sensing the presence of an occupant. A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>

<p>3. Whole-House protection - This is what I had mentioned above. While it is true that most people can safely re-wire a plug and there is no need to call an electrician for that one, any tasks more complicated than that, including fitting replacement switches; would be better left to the professional unless you know exactly what you are doing. But models featuring outlet with built in surge protector are also present.
