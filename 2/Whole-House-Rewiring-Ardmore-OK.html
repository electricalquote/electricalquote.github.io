<p>Fortunately, you can protect your equipment by simply installing surge protectors where these appliances plug into your wall. When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches.

<p>Electricity is important to the workings of the home, but can be dangerous, especially to children. Transmission and Distribution Construction services (includes electrical design, development, maintenance and testing services)Transmission lines carry high voltage current from the substation, where the power is produced. Arc faults happen when electricity crosses a gap between damaged wiring such as loose, corroded, or overloaded connections in walls, appliances, and cords.</p>
