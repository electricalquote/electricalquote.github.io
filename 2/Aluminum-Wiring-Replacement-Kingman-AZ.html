<p>Power generators have two main components. If they look OK, then you'd use your DMM to see if there's power to them, and, of course, on the motor side of each one. Maintain your whole house generator regularly by having a scheduled maintenance routine to ensure it lasts long enough. To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals.
