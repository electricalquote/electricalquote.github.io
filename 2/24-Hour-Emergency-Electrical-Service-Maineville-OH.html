<p>Renovations Landscaping's Outdoor Lighting Technicians are there when you need them most. We recommend this Kitchler Power Transformer with a Wi-Fi controller and timer. Warranties on fixtures and transformers range from one to 10 years, but fixtures made of brass, copper, or stainless steel should shine indefinitely.

<p>When choosing a transformer, it's important to pick one that can handle the total wattage of your fixtures. Master Electrician: You need to hold a valid journeyman electrician license for at least 2 years with at least 12,000 hours of on-the-job training under a master electrician. Workers with proper electrical training keep plant operations and equipment running smoothly. I trust TLC, and enjoy (as much is possible with plumbing issues) working with them. Attaching the cable for the lights to the transformer is an easy task of screwing the wires in place.</p>
<p>Or you must have an accredited BS degree in electrical engineering, plus have one year of licensed experience. High school students considering electrician careers should take courses that offer some exposure to electrical principles, such as mathematics, physics and other technical sciences.

<p>Sometimes, simply moving a couple of your electricity-producing devices to a different breaker will fix the problem. To ensure that the job is done professionally, you want to know that you're booking a professional electrician, with all the right qualifications. Now that the old fixture is down, you will have already read the directions of your cable track lighting kit and then you will attach the new wires to the fixture that is in place.
