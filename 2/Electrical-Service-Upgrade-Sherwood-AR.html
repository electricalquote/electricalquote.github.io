Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts.

Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
