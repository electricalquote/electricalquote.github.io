<p>Blue Streak technicians are trained to work on all types of lighting fixtures. Outdoor low voltage lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes and can provide safety and beauty to your home - and it doesn't have to cost a fortune to install. Without a breaker panel, none of your electronic devices or appliances will work.

Most of the time, this would simply require making sure that the light switch that operates the ceiling fixture, is turned to the off position.</p>
