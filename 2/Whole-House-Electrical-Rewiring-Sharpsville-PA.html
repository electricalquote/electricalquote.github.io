<p>Spotlighting: We typically highlight one or two of your property's focal points using spotlighting. The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>

<p>On this one, it tests, correctly, with a plug-in AC tester, when the outlet is just connected, but, not yet inserted into the enclosure box. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid as a percentage of the Journeyman's pay.
